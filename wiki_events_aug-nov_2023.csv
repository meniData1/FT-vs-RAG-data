4,United States abortion protests (2022–present),Summary,,"A series of ongoing protests supporting abortion rights and anti-abortion counter-protests began in the United States on May 2, 2022, following the leak of a draft majority opinion for the U.S. Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which stated that the Constitution of the United States does not confer any Reproductive rights, thus overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court officially overturned Roe and Casey in Dobbs, resulting in further protests outside of the U.S. Supreme Court building and across the country, eventually to major cities across the world both in favor of and against the decision."
5,United States abortion protests (2022–present),Background,Leaked draft opinion,"On May 2, 2022, Politico released a first draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, the authenticity of which Politico said it had verified. The draft opinion would overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey if held by the majority and thereby finalized in that form. Alito's draft decision called the Roe decision ""egregiously wrong from the start"" on the grounds that abortion is not listed in the United States Constitution as a protected right, and instead would allow states to decide on abortion restrictions or guarantees under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.Shortly after the release of the document, multiple protests occurred in cities throughout the country and outside the U.S. Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C., along with multiple individuals such as lawyers, politicians, and activist groups speaking out about the leaked draft.

13,United States abortion protests (2022–present),Response,About protests outside private homes,"After protests outside of the homes of Justices John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh in early May 2022, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki tweeted that while President Joe Biden was a strong believer in the constitutional right to protest, it should never include violence, threats, or vandalism. Psaki added that Judges were a highly important function in the United States and must be able to do their jobs without concern for personal safety. The U.S. Capitol Police and the National Fusion Center Association alerted to potential violence in Washington, D.C., against the nine justices and their staffs as well as nationwide against abortion-related advocacy groups and First Amendment-protected events. In May, senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced legislation to allow Supreme Court Police to provide all nine justices and their families 24-hour protection. The bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives on June 14 in a 396–27 vote, with opposition from some New Jersey Democrats who wished to broaden the bill to also protect the family members of Supreme Court staff, and was signed into law by President Biden on June 16.Republicans argued that those protests violate a 1950 federal law that criminalizes attempting to influence a judge in the course of their official duties by demonstrating at their residence. Maryland governor Larry Hogan and Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin cited the law in a request to the U.S. Department of Justice for adequate resources to protect the justices and their families. Justice Clarence Thomas said the Supreme Court would not ""be bullied"" by the demonstrators. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) stated in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News that the protests at the Justices homes were ""mob violence to get their partisan outcome""; however, reports from both protests claimed to show no violence and about 100 protestors attending the protests.On May 16, Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed a law making it a second-degree misdemeanor to protest in front of private citizen's homes in Florida, saying, ""Sending unruly mobs to private residences, like we have seen with the angry crowds in front of the homes of Supreme Court justices, is inappropriate."" Despite the timing, the law was unrelated to the Dobbs decision, as it had been introduced two months prior."

27,American–Japanese–Korean trilateral pact,Summary,,"The American–Japanese–Korean trilateral pact, Camp David Principles or simply with acronym JAROKUS is a security pact  between Japan, South Korea, and the United States which was announced on 18 August 2023, at Camp David in the United States. The pact commits the three countries to a set of agreements and is regarded as one of U.S. led international security alliances in recent decade, including Quad Plus and AUKUS."
28,American–Japanese–Korean trilateral pact,Background,Japan–South Korea relations and Indo-Pacific threats,"From 1910 to 1945, Korea was ruled by the Empire of Japan. Under Japanese rule, Korean women—primarily from South Korea—were forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army. Japan's rule of Korea has strained relations between the two countries. With the incoming administrations of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, both countries made significant amends. In March 2023, Yoon ended the South Korean government's requests to Japanese companies to pay Korean laborers enslaved during World War II. South Korea and Japan have supported Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine as China and Russia have furthered their relations.China's presence in the Indo-Pacific region has concerned the United States; relations between the two countries has remained low. In October 2022, North Korea fired a missile over Japan, followed by a nuclear threat to South Korea in March 2023. Through an agreement with the United States, Japan and South Korea have real-time information on North Korea's ballistic missiles."
29,American–Japanese–Korean trilateral pact,Background,Attempts to stabilize the Indo-Pacific region,"In April 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden announced that any attacks against South Korea by North Korea would result in the ""end"" of Kim Jong Un's rule. At the White House, Yoon vowed to produce nuclear weapons. Japan declined to participate in a move attributed by the United States to domestic politics."
30,American–Japanese–Korean trilateral pact,Camp David summit,,"At Camp David on 18 August 2023, Biden announced the pact, marking the first time that international leaders visited the retreat since 2015, when then-president Barack Obama held a Gulf Cooperation Council summit there. The summit was the first time in Biden's presidency that journalists were allowed on Camp David's grounds."
31,American–Japanese–Korean trilateral pact,Implementation,,"The pact implements a formal casus foederis in which a threat to one member constitutes a threat against all, but does not mirror Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty; the response to an attack against one member must be discussed. The pact also improves trilateral ballistic missile defense and military exercises. The three countries will develop a security framework for the Indo-Pacific region."
32,August 2023 Ohio Issue 1,Summary,,"A special election was held in the U.S. state of Ohio on August 8, 2023, on a referendum that would have made it substantially harder for voter-led initiatives to amend the Ohio State Constitution be proposed and approved.The initiative was defeated by a decisive margin of 57% to 43% amid unusually high voter turnout for an off-year election held in August, with over 3 million ballots cast overall.
The intent of this initiative, according to its creator, Republican State Representative Brian Stewart, was to ""[stop] a whole host of [referendum] issues that we know are coming down the pike"" including on redistricting, qualified immunity, the minimum wage and, most notably, abortion; a referendum to restore Roe v. Wade-era access to abortion in the state appeared on the November 2023 ballot and passed by a 57% to 43% margin."
33,August 2023 Ohio Issue 1,Background,,"Issue 1 was proposed by State Representative Stewart and the state's top election official, Secretary of State Frank LaRose. According to Stewart, Issue 1 is intended to stop ""far-left ballot proposals"" and ""ballot campaigns [featuring] destructive policies that [liberal groups] could never get through a state legislature"", while according to LaRose, Issue 1 is ""100% about keeping a radical pro-abortion amendment out of our constitution"". LaRose later claimed that his statement was taken out of context and generally called the issue a ""good government"" move that blocks influence from out-of-state special interests.The amendment was supported by the Republican Party of Ohio and opposed by a multipartisan coalition of groups including the Democratic Party of Ohio, Libertarian Party of Ohio, Green Party of Ohio, and several former Republican officials; with the former claiming that the amendment was necessary to prevent advocacy groups from lobbying their interests into the state constitution, and the latter arguing that the amendment was undemocratic and would result in minority rule. Four former governors of Ohio, John Kasich, Ted Strickland, Bob Taft, and Dick Celeste, favored a ""no"" vote on Issue 1, along with a large majority of Ohio newspapers, who argued that Issue 1's passage would have the effect of centralizing power in the state government and limit the power of voters to effect political change. Incumbent Republican governor Mike DeWine supported it.The issue was widely seen as being related to the issue of abortion in Ohio, as a referendum to restore legal access to elective abortion in the state would be held in November 2023. Thus, the scheduling of the Issue 1 vote was seen as an attempt to raise the success threshold before the abortion vote could take place. In addition, advocacy groups also attempted to use the referendum as an attack to LGBT rights, mainly, transgender rights.The decision to hold the election in August as opposed to November was criticized as an attempt to help the amendment's passage by capitalizing on historically low voter turnout in special elections. In fact, the Ohio General Assembly had passed, and Governor DeWine had signed, House Bill 458 just months earlier, among the provisions of which eliminated August special elections except in cases of fiscal emergency; the stated rationale for this provision, given by Secretary of State Frank LaRose and others at the time, was the consistently low turnout seen in historical August elections. After the Issue 1 vote was scheduled for August 2023, LaRose defended this apparent contradiction by saying that HB 458 does not apply to state legislators, who are free to select any date they wish for a referendum on a constitutional amendment they refer to voters. Democrats rebutted this point, saying that legislators should have chosen from a list of election days that had already been set. A lawsuit was filed over the timing of the election, but on June 16, in a 4–3 ruling, the Ohio Supreme Court agreed with LaRose's interpretation and decided the election would continue as scheduled. The election cost state taxpayers $20 million.
Similar amendments to require supermajority support for state constitutional amendments have failed in various states, most recently in Arkansas in 2022. A comparable measure passed in Florida in 2006.In June 2023, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that part of the amendment was misleading and would have to be rewritten by the state's Ballot Board.Political scientist Jacob M. Grumbach claimed the passage of Issue 1 would likely lead to democratic backsliding, citing the proposed measure as among a ""growing use of moves that defy norms of democratic behavior""."
34,August 2023 Ohio Issue 1,Provisions,,"If approved by voters, the amendment would have changed the Ohio State Constitution, modifying the Initiative and Referendum Process Amendment of 1912, which created a method for citizen-initiated direct democracy in Ohio.A ""yes"" vote on Issue 1 was a vote to change the Ohio Constitution by:

Requiring signatures from all 88 counties to get an amendment on the ballot, instead of the current 44 counties (50%).
Removing the 10-day cure period (a period allowing fixes to any errors in the collected signatures).
Increasing the passing percentage from a simple majority (50%+1) vote to a three-fifths supermajority (60%) on citizen and legislature-initiated referendums.Had the amendment passed the second and third  provisions would have taken effect immediately, while the first provision would have taken effect on January 1, 2024.A ""no"" vote on Issue 1 was a vote to keep the Ohio Constitution as is, by:

Keeping the number of counties from which signatures are required to get an amendment on the ballot at 44 counties (50%)
Keeping the 10-day cure period.
Maintaining the passing percentage of a citizen-initiated referendum at a simple majority (50%+1 vote), without creating a difference between citizen-initiated referendums and legislature-initiated referendums."

39,Burning Man 2023,Background,,"Burning Man is a week-long gathering of art, community, self-expression, and self-reliance held in the Black Rock Desert in Pershing County, Nevada. The festival lies on Lake Lahontan, a large lake that desiccated due to Pleistocene climate change, leaving a dry lake, or playa, in the northwestern Nevada region. Burning Man attracts tens of thousands of attendees, including artists, musicians, and activists. The event is guided by self-sufficiency; most attendees must bring their own food, water, and supplies in an event similar to wilderness camping with performances. Burning Man features an eponymous burning of a large, wooden effigy known as the ""Man"". Attendees, known as ""Burners"", create a civilization known as Black Rock City comprising villages, a medical center, and an airport. To enter Burning Man, participants must either use the airport or a section of Nevada State Route 447."
40,Burning Man 2023,Festival,,"The theme of Burning Man 2023 was ""Animalia"", celebrating the ""animal world and our place in it"". Organizers closed Burning Man's gates before the event due to Hurricane Hilary. The beginning of the festival was disrupted when protesters blocked the highway to the Black Rock Desert asking for organizers to ban private planes, single-use plastics, and limit its power usage. Four people were arrested. A box representing war-torn Ukraine entitled ""Phoenix"" was burned at the festival, the work of fabricators in Kyiv and Chicago. Before its burning, the box played audio of explosions and air raid sirens as an opera singer performed a Ukrainian song. An estimated 73,000 people attended the festival at a cost of US$575 per person for a regular ticket.Celebrities who attended the festival included Diplo, Chris Rock, Kelly Gale, and Joel Kinnaman."
41,Burning Man 2023,Rainfall and exodus,,"On September 1, heavy rainfall hit Nevada. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning through September 4. Burning Man advised attendees that they should shelter in place and closed the front entrance. Between .5 inches (13 mm) and 1 inch (25 mm) of rain fell on September 1. Despite organizers stating that the gate and airport in Black Rock City were closed, authorities said participants were free to leave. The Bureau of Land Management urged attendees heading to the event to turn around. Organizers suggested that participants should walk to Gerlach, though reserved that hotel rooms in Gerlach are booked and discouraged attendees from walking in the dark, and provided buses to Reno there. Heather Richards, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Reno, told the Los Angeles Times that playa mud is ""so thick that you'll sink right into it and be stuck there for a while"". Festival officials released a ""Wet Playa Survival Guide"" to help attendees deal with the conditions.The Nevada Department of Transportation closed travel lanes on Route 447. According to Pershing County sheriff Jerry Allen, some vehicles have caused damage to the playa. Allen urged attendees to avoid driving out of the festival. The Burning Man Organization pledged to open up internet access and deploy mobile cell trailers. The burning of the Man was delayed and one person died. Disc jockey Diplo and comedian Chris Rock attended the festival and walked six miles (10 km) through mud before catching a ride in a pickup truck. Former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal took a six-mile (10 km) hike, describing the journey as ""harrowing"". Some attendees remained defiant to the pluvial weather conditions.The roads were re-opened on September 4. On that same night, the effigy was burned, two days behind its original schedule. The five-mile-long dirt road leading to the nearest highway took over five hours to exit due to the amount of traffic, which had formed into ten lanes. Many vehicles were marooned."

49,Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case),Summary,,"United States of America v. Donald J. Trump is a pending federal criminal case against Donald Trump, the president of the United States from 2017 to 2021, regarding his alleged participation in attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election including his involvement in the January 6 Capitol attack.
Trump questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election, claiming that election fraud had occurred through mail-in ballots, voting machine irregularities, ""dead voters"", and other irregularities. He also directly attempted to overturn the results of the election through a plot in which pro-Trump slates of fake electors would be created. Trump pressured then-vice president Mike Pence to count the fake electors instead of the electors certified by state legislators. The Department of Justice opened an investigation in January 2022 into the plot, expanding it to encompass January 6. In November 2022, attorney general Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith to lead a special counsel investigation encompassing the investigations into attempts to overturn the election and Trump's handling of government documents.
On August 1, 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump in the District of Columbia U.S. District Court on four charges for his conduct following the 2020 presidential election through the January 6 Capitol attack: conspiracy to defraud the United States under Title 18 of the United States Code, obstructing an official proceeding and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding under the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, and conspiracy against rights under the Enforcement Act of 1870. The indictment mentioned six unnamed co-conspirators. It is Trump's third indictment and the first indictment against a U.S. president concerning actions while in office. Trump appeared at an arraignment on August 3, where he pleaded not guilty. The charge with the longest sentence carries a maximum of 20 years in prison.As of August 2023, the trial is scheduled for March 4, 2024."
50,Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case),Background,Accusations of electoral fraud and attempts to overturn the election,"Throughout his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly sowed doubt on the election certification process. Campaigning in Colorado, Trump claimed without evidence that the Democratic Party ""[rigged] the election at polling booths"". In October 2016, Trump claimed through a series of tweets that widespread voter fraud would occur in the 2016 presidential election. These statements were echoed by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's legal advisor. Trump continued expressing these sentiments into the 2020 presidential election; for months, he prepared arguments in the event of his loss, primarily relating to mail-in ballots. As early as August 2020, he enlisted conservative activist and lawyer Cleta Mitchell to help overturn the election. The Department of Homeland Security warned that Russia was amplifying claims of fraud occurring in mail-in voting to intentionally sow distrust in the voting process as a whole. Two days before Election Day, Trump told reporters that he would be ""going in with [his] lawyers"" as soon as the election was over.Bolstered by pro-Trump pundits and perceived strong turnouts at rallies, the Trump campaign was confident that they were going to win the election. On Election Day, preliminary surveys at polling places showed Trump in the lead as his supporters were more likely to turn out in person amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but his lead diminished as mail-in ballots were counted. Following Trump's final campaign event in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump's son Eric wagered that he would win at least 322 electoral votes. At the behest of Giuliani, Trump declared in a 2 a.m. election night speech in the East Room that he had won the election and that the counts being reported were fraudulent. As ballots were being counted, campaign data expert Matt Oczkowski bluntly informed Trump that he was going to lose the election. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone told him that invalidating the results of the election would be a ""murder-suicide pact"". Under then-attorney general William Barr, the Department of Justice failed to find widespread voter fraud in the election. Former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich predicted that Trump voters would erupt in ""rage"", a sentiment shared by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who told Laura Ingraham on The Ingraham Angle that Republicans should not ""be silent about this"".Trump and several co-conspirators repeatedly sought to overturn the results of the election. The Department of Justice investigation into these attempts focused on the implementation of the Trump fake electors plot, in which Trump and his allies would draft allegedly fraudulent certificates of ascertainment affirming Trump as the winner. The effort to write these documents and persuade Republican officials to sign them was performed by Trump's lawyers, including Giuliani and John Eastman, who claimed that irregularities in the election had occurred and proposed that an ""alternate"" slate of electors should be established while they gathered evidence. Although dozens of these electors were installed and affirmed Trump as the winner, the seven state legislatures targeted in the plot—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—certified Biden's victory, although Pennsylvania and New Mexico agreed to consider Trump the winner if he succeeded in the many lawsuits challenging the election. The scheme involved sending the fake electoral slates to vice president Mike Pence, pressuring him to count the fake votes. Alternatively, Trump allies posited that Pence could consider the election ""defective"" under the Electoral Count Act and allow the House of Representatives to decide the outcome.During the two months following the election, Trump made multiple phone calls to Republican officials in states that had narrowly been won by Biden, asking them to reverse the results and give the victory to him. One such call was to Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, asking him to ""find 11,780 votes"". Raffensperger recorded the call and subsequently released it to the public. Both Trump and Giuliani called Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, asking him to look into claims of fraud, but he declined to do so without evidence. John Eastman also called Bowers on January 4 asking him to undo the state's certification of Biden's win, but he refused. Trump and his attorneys, as well as Republican members of Congress, also called or met with state officials in Michigan and Pennsylvania, urging them to report that Trump had actually won their states."
51,Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case),Background,January 6 Capitol attack and investigations,"On December 19, 2020, six weeks following his election loss, Trump urged his followers on Twitter to protest in Washington, D.C. on January 6, the day Congress was set to certify the results of the election, writing, ""Be there, will be wild!"" Over the course of the following weeks, Trump would repeat the January 6 date. Militant organizations such as the Proud Boys and groups affiliated with the conspiracy theory QAnon formulated logistical plans to gather at the United States Capitol. The Red-State Secession Facebook page encouraged its followers to post the addresses of its ""enemies"". Trump continued to repeat false claims about the election in multiple states leading up to January 6, including Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona. On the morning of January 6, Trump gave a speech in the Ellipse, an elliptical park near the White House, and encouraged his followers to walk down to Pennsylvania Avenue to incite within Republicans lawmakers the ""kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country"". Provoked by Trump, the mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.The January 6 Capitol attack resulted in hundreds of criminal proceedings. The House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump for a second time on January 13. He was acquitted by the Senate on February 13. The House of Representatives voted to create a select committee to investigate the attack in June 2021. Ahead of its final report, the committee voted to accuse Trump of the four charges later brought against him in the indictment and referred him to the Department of Justice. In a CNN interview in January 2022, deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco stated that the Department of Justice would investigate the Trump fake electors plot. By March 2022, the Department of Justice had opened an investigation into the events of January 6 and Trump's attempts to overturn the election. The Department of Justice began obtaining White House phone records in April in connection with the January 6 investigation, and a federal grand jury issued subpoenas to Trump's lawyers in connection with the fake electors plot in May. The Washington Post reported in July that the Department of Justice was investigating Trump's actions on January 6.The January 6 investigation was overseen by Thomas Windom, an obscure federal prosecutor. On November 18, 2022, attorney general Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith to serve as special counsel for the January 6 investigation and the FBI investigation into Donald Trump's handling of government documents. Smith intensified both investigations ahead of increased efforts by Trump to focus on his 2024 presidential campaign. In June 2023, Trump was indicted in connection with the classified documents investigation. Leading up to Trump's indictment in the January 6 investigation, prosecutors continued investigating several strands, including through hundreds of documents provided by former New York Police Department commissioner Bernard Kerik. On July 18, Trump was given a target letter. The following week, his lawyers met with prosecutors, signaling the investigation was nearly complete."
52,Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case),Proceedings,Indictment,"The indictment was unsealed on August 1, 2023. A grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia indicted Trump on four charges: conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstructing an official proceeding, conspiring to do so, and conspiracy against rights. D.C. district judge Tanya S. Chutkan was randomly assigned to hear the case.According to the indictment, on December 8, 2020, a senior campaign advisor admitted that ""our research and campaign legal team can't back up any of the claims ... It's tough to own any of this when it's all just conspiracy shit beamed down from the mothership."" On January 1, Trump learned that Mike Pence did not believe the vice president could reject electoral votes. Trump called Pence and told him, ""You're too honest."" On January 3, it is alleged that White House deputy counsel Patrick F. Philbin privately said that if Trump held onto power, there would be ""riots in every major city in the United States"", to which ""Co-conspirator No. 4"" (likely Jeffrey Clark) replied ""That's why there's an Insurrection Act"", implying that Trump could command the military to keep himself in power. The indictment also described a previously unreported discussion between Trump and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, in which Cipollone advised Trump, hours after the Capitol riot started, to drop his objections to the election. Trump refused."
53,Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case),Proceedings,Arraignment,"Trump appeared before magistrate judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya at the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington, D.C., on August 3. Smith was present at the arraignment, as were Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran and chief judge James Boasberg.

Trump pleaded not guilty to each count, and prosecutors confirmed they would not seek pre-trial detention."
54,Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case),Proceedings,Post-arraignment,
55,Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case),Reactions,Defendant,"The Trump campaign responded to the indictment with a press release, accusing President Joe Biden of political persecution and claiming that it was election interference. The Trump campaign issued a statement calling the indictment ""reminiscent of Nazi Germany"", which was strongly criticized by Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League, as well as the American Jewish Committee and the Jewish Democratic Council of America."
56,Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case),Reactions,Republicans in support of the indictment,"Mike Pence, who was Trump's vice president and, at the time, was also running for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election, issued a statement strongly condemning Trump, stating that this indictment was ""an important reminder [that] anyone who puts himself over the constitution should never be president of the United States"". In an interview with reporters at the Indiana State Fair the next day, he expanded on his comments, stating that he could not have overturned the election results as vice president.
Former U.S. attorney general William Barr said the case against Trump was legitimate and that he will testify if he is called.
Adam Kinzinger, a member of the January 6 Committee and a former Illinois representative, tweeted that ""Today is the beginning of justice"" and added that Trump is ""a cancer on our democracy"".
Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who is running for the 2024 presidential Republican nomination, said Trump ""swore an oath to the Constitution, violated his oath & brought shame to his presidency.""
Former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, who is running for the 2024 presidential Republican nomination, said ""Trump has disqualified himself from ever holding our nation's highest office again.""
On August 14, 2023, nearly a dozen former judges and federal legal officials, all appointed by Republicans, submitted an amicus brief saying they agreed with Jack Smith's proposed trial date of January 2, 2024. The brief states ""There is no more important issue facing America and the American people‍—‍and to the very functioning of democracy‍—‍than whether the former president is guilty of criminally undermining America’s elections and American democracy in order to remain in power [...]""."
57,Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case),Reactions,Republicans opposed to the indictment,"Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida who is also running for the 2024 presidential Republican nomination, tweeted that he would ""end the weaponization of government, replace the FBI director, and ensure a single standard of justice for all Americans"" if elected. He also voiced agreement with the defendant's claim that the charges were politically motivated. In addition, DeSantis has previously expressed his intention to pardon Trump if he were to win the presidency.
Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy wrote on Twitter that House Republicans would ""continue to uncover the truth about Biden Inc. and the two-tiered system of justice.""
With a looming September 30 deadline to fund the government for the coming fiscal year starting October 1, some House Republicans had proposed leveraging their power of the purse to try to stop the federal and state prosecutions of Trump, though a federal shutdown would not affect the prosecutions."
58,Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case),Reactions,Democrats in support of the indictment,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in a joint statement with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said ""No one is above the law – including Donald Trump"".
House members Nancy Pelosi, Joaquin Castro and Rashida Tlaib also came out in support of the indictment."

65,Hurricane Franklin (2023),Summary,,"Hurricane Franklin was a long-lived, erratic, and powerful hurricane that brought tropical-storm force winds to parts of the Greater Antilles and Bermuda. The seventh named storm, second hurricane and first major hurricane of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, Franklin impacted Hispaniola as a tropical storm before strengthening into a high-end Category 4 hurricane several days later. Possessing a large wind field, the hurricane produced tropical storm force winds over Bermuda and soon became extratropical as it accelerated into the open northern Atlantic.
Franklin brought heavy rainfall and wind, causing damage to buildings, homes, and light posts. Two fatalities were reported in the Dominican Republic, with an additional person also missing.  At least 350 people were displaced, and more than 500 homes and 2,500 roads were affected or damaged. Several communities in the Dominican Republic were cut off, and nearly 350,000 homes were left without power, with an additional 1.6 million homes cut off from potable water."
66,Hurricane Franklin (2023),Meteorological history,,"On August 17, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an elongated trough of low pressure located well to the east-southeast of the Lesser Antilles for the possibility of slow development. An area of low pressure formed on August 19 east of the Leeward Islands, and after entering the Caribbean Sea on August 20, the disturbance organized into Tropical Storm Franklin. Over the next couple of days, Franklin drifted through weak steering currents, while battling moderate wind shear. This gave the cyclone a disheveled appearance with most of convection to the east of its center and the NHC noted multiple times that Franklin may have not had a well-defined center of circulation on August 22. Early on August 23, the storm began moving northwestward before turning northward, becoming somewhat better organized, allowing it to intensify. Franklin then made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) south of Barahona, Dominican Republic, shortly before 12:00 UTC on August 23.
Weakening occurred after Franklin made landfall, and it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean at 21:00 UTC as a minimal tropical storm. After drifting eastward and struggling with strong westerly shear and land interaction for several days, Franklin entered a more favorable environment for development on August 25 and promptly intensified into a Category 1 hurricane the next morning. A further decrease in wind shear along with less dry air allowed Franklin to begin to rapidly intensify as it moved northwestward, becoming the season's first major hurricane at 09:00 UTC on August 28. Franklin then began to intensify even more rapidly, becoming a category 4 hurricane just over 2+1⁄2 hours later. Franklin then turned northward reached its peak intensity shortly afterwards with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and an estimated central pressure of 926 mbar (27.34 inHg) before initiating an eyewall replacement cycle, causing it to begin to slowly weaken as it turned northeastward. That trend continued after the cycle was completed as northerly wind shear from the outflow from Hurricane Idalia to the southwest increased over Franklin and by 09:00 UTC on August 30, it had weakened to Category 2 strength. The following day, while passing north of Bermuda, the wind shear over Franklin increased even further, causing the storm's eye to disappear as it became increasingly asymmetric and its forward speed to accelerate.That same day, Franklin began losing its tropical characteristics, and by 21:00 UTC on September 1 it had become a hurricane-force extratropical cyclone. Shortly thereafter, the strong cyclone absorbed the smaller and weaker Tropical Storm Jose, which was situated to its east, following a brief Fujiwhara interaction. Afterward, the system accelerated towards the northeast. By September 4, it was located north of the Azores, then, it moved southeastward to near the northwestern coast of Spain three days later. As the system was moving over warmer waters at the time, the NHC began to monitor it again for possible redevelopment. Some reorganization did take place, but the system did not regenerate into a tropical or subtropical cyclone. The NHC stopped monitoring the post-tropical cyclone as it moved northward on September 7, and the remnant cyclone dissipated two days later."
67,Hurricane Franklin (2023),Preparations and impact,Dominican Republic,"Schools, governmental buildings, and airports were closed until August 24. In the Dominican Republic, more than 200 people were in shelters, and 24 of the 31 provinces in the country were under a red alert. Around 3,300 residents in low-lying areas were evacuated to higher grounds ahead of the storm. An additional 352 people were in government shelters.Franklin brought heavy rainfall and wind, causing damage to buildings and homes, leaving numerous communities isolated. Nearly 350,000 homes were left without power and 1.6 million homes were cut off from potable water. Around 830,000 aqueduct users were affected after close to 120 aqueducts were put out of service. Santo Domingo recorded 330.7 mm (13.02 in) of rain from Franklin. Two people, including a teenager, were killed. A 15-year-old boy died after falling into the Rio Nigua, while another man was killed in San Cristóbal as he attempted to cross a ravine.

77,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Summary,,"The State of Georgia v. Donald J. Trump, et al. is a pending criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, and 18 co-defendants. The prosecution alleges that Trump led a ""criminal racketeering enterprise"", in which he and all other defendants ""knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome"" of the 2020 U.S. presidential election in Georgia. All defendants are charged with one count of violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, which has a penalty of five to twenty years in prison. The indictment comes in the context of Trump's broader effort to overturn his loss in the 2020 presidential election. It is one of four ongoing criminal indictments against Trump.
Defendants are variously charged with forty additional counts from other allegations, including: Trump and co-defendants plotted to create pro-Trump slates of fake electors; Trump called the Georgia Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, asking him to ""find 11,780 votes"", which would have reversed his loss in the state by a single vote margin; and a small group of Trump allies in Coffee County, Georgia illegally accessed voting systems attempting to find evidence of election fraud.
A grand jury handed up the indictments on August 14, 2023, following an investigation launched in February 2021 by Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis. Four defendants have pleaded guilty to some of the charges and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution, and the rest have pleaded not guilty. The case is set to be heard in the Fulton County Superior Court with judge Scott McAfee presiding. Another judge denied requests from former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Department of Justice (DOJ) official Jeffrey Clark, and three other defendants to have their cases removed to federal court."
78,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Background,Prior to and during election day,"Weeks before the 2016 presidential election, Trump claimed through a series of tweets that widespread voter fraud was imminent, a sentiment echoed by his legal advisor, Rudy Giuliani. Trump repeated the accusations throughout his presidency and into his 2020 reelection campaign; for months, he prepared arguments in the event of his loss, primarily relating to mail-in ballots. As early as August 2020, he enlisted conservative activist and lawyer Cleta Mitchell to help overturn the election. Two days before Election Day (November 3, 2020), he told reporters that he would be ""going in with [his] lawyers"" as soon as the election was over.On Election Day, preliminary surveys at polling places showed Trump in the lead as his supporters were more likely to turn out in person amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but his lead diminished as mail-in ballots were counted. At the behest of Giuliani, Trump declared in a 2 a.m. election night speech in the East Room that he had won the election and that the counts being reported were fraudulent. As ballots were being counted, campaign data expert Matt Oczkowski bluntly informed Trump that he was going to lose the election. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone told him that invalidating the results of the election would be a ""murder-suicide pact"". Under then-attorney general William Barr, the Department of Justice failed to find widespread voter fraud in the election.Former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich predicted that Trump voters would erupt in ""rage"", a sentiment shared by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who told Laura Ingraham on The Ingraham Angle that Republicans should ""not be silent about this""."
79,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Background,Efforts to pressure Georgia state officials,"On December 3, 2020, a 7-hour hearing of the Georgia Senate Committee on the Judiciary heard Trump's legal team, including Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, made false claims alleging fraud and misconduct in the state's election process, and that the Georgia legislature had the power to appoint electors for Trump. A similar presentation was made to the Georgia House of Representatives Committee on Governmental Relations.
On December 7, Trump called Georgia House Speaker David Ralston asking him to convene a special session of the state legislature to overturn the Georgia election results.In late December 2020 and early January 2021, Jeffrey Clark, the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division and acting for the DOJ Civil Division, drafted a letter to Georgia officials stating the DOJ had ""identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States,"" urging the Georgia legislature to convene a special session for the ""purpose of considering issues pertaining to the appointment of Presidential Electors."" Clark presented the draft letter to acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue for their signatures; they rejected the proposal and the letter was never sent.Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to change the state's election results during an hour-long conference call on January 2, 2021. Trump told Raffensperger, ""What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes, which is one more than [the 11,779-vote margin of defeat] we have, because we won the state.""On September 17, Trump wrote to Raffensperger, alleging that 43,000 ballots in DeKalb County had been mishandled and that Raffensperger should ""start the process of decertifying the election, or whatever the correct legal remedy is, and announce the true winner."" In the 2023 Georgia indictment, the 38th and 39th counts address this act."
80,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Background,Creation of false electoral vote documents,"The plan to recruit false electors for Donald Trump and pressure public officials to accept them was spearheaded by Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman in support of the Trump campaign and with the awareness of Trump himself, although other campaign staff expressed doubts about the plan. The plan led to false documents being produced in seven states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.As is typical, the 16 potential electors for Trump in Georgia were chosen before the election. After Biden won the election, and days before the scheduled casting of electoral votes, the Republican electors received calls asking them to come to the Georgia State Capitol to cast ""alternate"" ballots, ostensibly in case Texas v. Pennsylvania was ruled in favor of Trump. However, that case was thrown out on December 11, 2020, three days before the electoral vote was to occur, a fact that was withheld from most of the fake electors by Giuliani and Kenneth Chesebro. Four members of the Republican electoral slate declined to participate, including former U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, and were replaced.Georgia fake electors convened in a meeting room at the state Capitol at the same time the true electors were meeting in the state Senate chamber. State senator Shawn Still verified fake electors' identities as they entered the room, but the meeting was reportedly open to the public, and video was posted that day. Unlike some other states, the Georgia false certificate of ascertainment did not contain language specifying it was to be used only if the Trump campaign prevailed in litigation (one state case, Trump v. Raffensperger, was still pending at the time). The falsified documents were then sent to the U.S. Senate and the National Archives by Giulianni and Chesebro's team."
81,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Background,Coffee County election equipment breach,"In the weeks after the election, Trump and his associates attacked the electronic voting company Dominion Voting Systems. In particular, they claimed that ballots were being altered in a process known as ""adjudication"", intended to resolve minor errors. Trump asserted that human operators could switch Trump-intended votes to Biden votes.On January 7, someone who had posed as a fake elector, and who had communicated with the Coffee County elections supervisor about election office access, escorted two Trump operatives into the office, which was captured on surveillance video. Allegedly assisted by employees of the data forensics firm SullivanStrickler, they copied data from voting equipment. In a recorded phone conversation, Atlanta Trump supporter Scott Hall recalled that the team ""scanned every freaking ballot"", including equipment and that they had ""imaged all the hard drives"" used on Election Day. The Washington Post reported in September 2023 that during the weeks following the 2020 election Hall had conversations with leaders of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Georgia. Georgia prosecutors said Hall had a 63-minute phone conversation with Jeffrey Clark on January 2, 2021.January 19 text messages between two men hired by the Trump legal team show intent to use the data to decertify the Georgia presidential results as well as the 2021 Georgia runoff election. The texts were between Sidney Powell associate Jim Penrose, a former National Security Agency official, and Doug Logan, whose firm Cyber Ninjas later ran the 2021 Maricopa County presidential ballot audit.The firm SullivanStrickler was subpoenaed by the special grand jury convened in this case in 2022. The company has insisted it is ""politically agnostic"" and had simply accepted paid work as a third-party contractor for the Trump campaign. During the investigation, the two Trump operatives admitted that Sidney Powell had sent them and that they had accessed a voting machine inside the building. Cathy Latham, one of the fake electors who had escorted them into the building, invoked the Fifth Amendment.Of the 18 co-defendants indicted on August 14, 2023, four—Powell, Hampton, Latham, and Hall—are charged in the Coffee County breach."
82,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Background,Harassment of Fulton County election workers,"After the election, Trump and Giuliani amplified a video that was taken out of context, and used the footage to make baseless claims that Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea ""Shaye"" Moss had committed election fraud. Giuliani accused them of ""passing around USB ports as if they were vials of heroin or cocaine"" and engaging in ""surreptitious illegal activity"", citing video footage that, according to Moss, actually showed the women with ""a ginger mint"". The women and their family members were subjected to anti-Black racist smears and death threats and were warned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that they would not be safe in their home.
Freeman and Moss sued Giuliani for defamation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in December 2021. Giuliani was ordered to pay $89,000 in attorney's fees to them in July 2023 after being sanctioned for failing to turn over evidence in the case. Giuliani admitted his statements had been ""defamatory per se"" yet denied they had caused ""any damages,"" on July 25. The judge entered a default judgment on August 30 against Giuliani due to his failure to produce subpoenaed documents.Moss testified in a June 2022 public hearing before the U.S. House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack that after Giuliani's remarks she and her family were subjected to a barrage of racist threats, including ""Be glad it's 2020 and not 1920,"" in reference to lynching in the United States. During her testimony, Freeman said ""There is nowhere I feel safe. Nowhere. Do you know how it feels to have the president of the United States target you?"" Moss said that the false accusations made against her had impacted her well-being ""in a major way—in every way—all because of lies."""
83,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Indictment,Charges,"The criminal charges fall into several clusters:

Violation of the Georgia RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) Act. This is a single blanket charge accusing all 19 defendants of engaging in a criminal enterprise to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election through obstructing the casting and counting of Georgia's electoral votes. 161 individual acts are listed in support of the criminal enterprise. RICO charges allow the court to consider evidence of alleged acts in other states.
Solicitation of violation of oath by public officer and false statements and writings to public officials. These charges relate to false assertions about purported election fraud. Most of these charges allege acts targeted at members of the Georgia General Assembly: seven at a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, two at a House Governmental Affairs Committee meeting, one to the Speaker of the House, and one for the attempt to have the Jeffrey Clark letter approved by U.S. Department of Justice officials.  Four were targeted at Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff, covering the Trump–Raffensperger phone call and another communication in September 2021.
Impersonating a public officer, forgery in the first degree, filing false documents and attempt to commit this, and false statements and writings in documents.  These charges relate to fake electors purporting to be true electors and creating and distributing two false documents: the certificate of ascertainment and its cover letter.  There is also one charge for a filing in the federal case Trump v. Kemp.  Fake electors and the federal case filers were charged with the underlying crimes, while others were charged with conspiracy to commit them.
Perjury and false statements and writings to investigators.  One charge for lying under oath to the Fulton County Special Purpose Grand Jury, and one for lying to investigators with the Fulton County District Attorney's Office.
Conspiracy to commit each of election fraud, computer theft, computer trespass, computer invasion of privacy, and to defraud the state.  These charges relate to a breach of voting equipment in Coffee County, Georgia.
Influencing witnesses and attempts to commit this, and conspiracy to commit solicitation of false statements and writings.  These charges relate to an attempt to harass and influence Fulton County election worker Ruby Freeman."
84,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Indictment,Remaining defendants,"The 19 defendants named in the indictment are listed in the following tables.  Conspiracy charge counts are in italics.  Attempt charge counts are underlined.  Note that Latham is listed separately in two of the tables, but her total includes charges from both tables together.
There is overlap with the co-conspirators mentioned in the federal indictment of Trump issued two weeks earlier. In the federal indictment, Giuliani was listed as co-conspirator No. #1, Eastman was #2, Powell was #3, Clark was #4, and Chesebro was #5. All five of these people, though not charged in the federal prosecution, are charged as co-defendants in the Georgia prosecution.The indictment references 30 ""unindicted co-conspirators"" who allegedly participated in some of the same criminal activities with the 19 defendants. These 30 people are not named in the indictment, but referred to by number. CNN, Just Security, The Washington Post and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution independently cross-referenced details in the indictment with already public information which does name the involved individuals, allowing many of them to be identified.  Notable unindicted co-conspirators include Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch, Trump and Giuliani associate Boris Epshteyn, former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, GOP political operative Phil Waldron, and current Lt. Governor of Georgia Burt Jones.Of the 16 fake Georgia electors, three fake electors are named as defendants in the present indictment, four have been identified with a specific unindicted co-conspirator description, and nine are not conclusively tied to a specific unindicted co-conspirator description."
85,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Initial proceedings,Surrender and booking,"After the grand jury issued arrest warrants for all 19 defendants per normal procedure, Willis provided the co-defendants an opportunity to voluntarily surrender by noon on August 25. All did so, and all but Floyd were immediately released on bond. The defendants surrendered to Fulton County Jail on these dates:

August 22: Eastman and Hall
August 23: Shafer, Latham, Smith, Chesebro, Giuliani, Powell, and Ellis
August 24: Trump, Meadows, and Floyd
August 25: Roman, Clark, Still, Hampton, Cheeley, Kutti, and LeeTrump agreed to a $200,000 bond on August 21. His pre-negotiated release conditions include only using attorneys to discuss the case with co-defendants or witnesses and not intimidating co-defendants, unindicted co-conspirators, or witnesses on social media. When he surrendered, he used a bail bondsman to post his bail. Trump's mug shot was taken, a procedure not required in his previous indictments. Trump self-reported to authorities a height of 6 ft 3 in (191 cm) and a weight of 215 pounds (98 kg); four months earlier, he told New York authorities he was 6 ft 2 in (188 cm) and 240 pounds (110 kg).Floyd did not negotiate a bond agreement prior to his surrender and was instead booked, then jailed. While in jail, he refused a consent bond offered by Willis's office. In a court hearing on August 25, he was denied bond, being deemed a flight risk due to a pending case against him in Maryland for misdemeanor assault on an FBI agent. He told the court that he was unable to afford a lawyer and ineligible for a court-appointed one. Floyd's bond was set at $100,000 on August 29, and he was released the next day.Giuliani had his bond set at $150,000; Chesebro, Clark, Eastman, Ellis, Floyd, Meadows, and Powell at $100,000; Kutti, Latham, Lee, and Shafer at $75,000; Cheeley, Roman, and Smith at $50,000; and Hall, Hampton, and Still at $10,000."
86,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Initial proceedings,Arraignments,"The arraignment was scheduled for September 6, but all 19 defendants waived their right to appear for their arraignment and pleaded not guilty on the following dates:

August 28: Smith
August 29: Powell and Kutti
August 31: Trump and Ellis
September 1: Giuliani, Chesebro, Cheeley, Lee, Roman, Floyd, and Hall
September 5: Meadows, Eastman, Clark, Latham, Still, Shafer, and HamptonChesebro, Ellis, Hall, and Powell each later pleaded guilty."
87,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Pretrial motions,Attempts to remove to federal court,"Five defendants asked the federal U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to move their cases to federal court, called ""removal."" Though all charges would remain under Georgia state law, the consequences of removal would include widening the geographic range of the jury pool and prohibiting cameras in the courtroom. District Court Judge Steve C. Jones  presided over all five hearings. All five defendants' motions to remove were denied in September 2023.On August 15, the day after the indictment, Meadows filed a motion to have his case removed to federal court, arguing that he is immune to state prosecution for any activities performed during his tenure as White House Chief of Staff under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. Meadows's removal hearing was on August 28. On September 8, Judge Jones rejected Meadows's request, finding he had not met even the ""quite low"" threshold for removal. Meadows immediately appealed the ruling to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and asked Jones for an emergency stay of his Georgia case while his appeal was pending. On September 12, Jones rejected Meadows's request to pause his case.On August 21, Clark also filed a motion to remove his case to federal court. Clark claimed the same protections from state prosecution as Meadows, as Clark was a Justice Department official at the time. His filing additionally argued that the entire case should be removed to federal court for all defendants. Clark's removal hearing was on September 18.  On September 29, Jones rejected the motion. On October 9, Clark appealed.Jones denied requests from Meadows and Clark to delay their arrests, so they surrendered to the Georgia court before their removal requests were heard.Defendants Shafer, Latham, and Still filed motions in August to remove the case to federal court. They asserted in these filings that they had convened as alternate electors ""at the direction of"" Trump via his attorneys, making them federal officials.  At a hearing on September 20, their lawyers argued that the Electoral Count Act of 1887 legally allowed the casting of contingent electoral ballots because a Georgia state court case was still pending past the specified safe harbor date, six days before the electoral vote date.  On September 29, Jones rejected the motion, noting that federal law does not in fact explicitly create the position of contingent elector. On October 6, Shafer, Latham, and Still appealed.Though Trump had formally indicated he might seek removal to federal court, he told the court on September 28, the day before his deadline to seek removal, that he would not do so."
88,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Pretrial motions,Speedy trial and severance requests,"On August 23, Chesebro requested a quick trial under Georgia's Speedy Trial Act. The judge set his trial for October 23, taking Willis's suggestion. (Willis additionally asked to try all 19 defendants speedily together on this date, but the judge did not immediately address her request.) On August 25, Powell also requested a speedy trial.On September 6, a hearing, the first televised one in the case, was held to address their requests to sever their cases from each other and from the other defendants. (Powell asserted she had ""no substantive connection"" with any other defendant.) Judge McAfee denied the Chesebro and Powell motions to sever from each other, and Powell's trial was set for the same day as Chesebro's. On September 29, special prosecutor Nathan Wade told McAfee that the DA's office would extend plea deals to Chesebro and Powell. Powell accepted a deal on October 19. Chesebro accepted a deal on October 20.Trump advised the court on August 24 that he opposed a speedy trial. He filed a motion to sever on August 31.Meadows has said he wants to be tried alone."
89,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Guilty pleas,Proffer video leak,"The four who pleaded guilty gave recorded interviews. Hampton's attorney, Jonathan Miller III, leaked these proffer videos to the media, and parts of them were published on November 13:
On September 29, Scott Hall complained he was never reimbursed for his charter flight to Coffee County on January 7, 2021, which he said he did ""for shits and giggles"" as a ""political tourist"" and a ""water boy"". He said the ""brain trust"" in the Coffee County breach included co-defendant Robert Cheeley, who had asked Hall (a bail bondsman) to help him locate Ruby Freeman.
On October 18, Sidney Powell told investigators that Giuliani, at a December 18, 2020, meeting in the Oval Office including Trump, had discussed accessing voting equipment. She said she still believed there was ""machine fraud"", though she also admitted she didn't know how the voting machines work, and that she personally would have considered using the military to seize voting machines if Trump had empowered her to do so by appointing her special counsel. She said Meadows told her the next morning: ""You know, it's not going to happen."" She said she called Trump for six minutes on December 24 ""[p]robably to see how he was doing and to say I'm sorry"" for losing the legal challenges. She maintained that she had nothing to do with the Coffee County breach.
On October 20, Kenneth Chesebro said he attended an Oval Office meeting on December 16, 2020, regarding Wisconsin, after which he briefed Trump on Arizona and told him the strategy he'd laid out in his November 18 memo. He said he played a role in sending the certificates for the Wisconsin slate of fake electors to Congress. He said he began communicating directly with John Eastman in late December and helped edit Eastman's December 23 memo. He said he flew to Capitol Hill on January 2, 2021, in case the Trump campaign invited him to participate in strategy meetings, which it did not.
On October 23, Jenna Ellis told investigators that Trump's deputy chief of staff, Dan Scavino, had told her in December 2020 that Trump would refuse to leave office. Ellis said: ""And he said to me, you know, in a kind of excited tone, 'Well, we don't care, and we're not going to leave.'"" She said that co-defendant Ray Smith had asked Preston Haliburton, a lawyer involved in Trump's election challenges in Georgia, to get security footage from an Atlanta center where ballots were counted; this footage contained the footage of Moss and Freeman.The day after the videos were published, Willis renewed her request for a protective order over discovery materials, this time on an emergency basis. Her court filing alleged that the leak was ""clearly intended to intimidate witnesses in this case."" Most defense attorneys agreed to allow some material to be marked ""sensitive"". Though Miller had argued that ""the public needs to know"" about the testimony (he said it helped his client's case), McAfee disagreed that it was appropriate ""to start litigating the case before we actually get inside of a courtroom"". On November 16, McAfee issued the protective order.Roman, Cheeley, Hampton, and at least three other defendants rejected similar plea deals. As of October 25, 2023, Trump, Giuliani, Meadows, and Eastman had not been offered deals."
90,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Trials,,"Unlike the proceedings in Trump's other three indictments where photography was not permitted, the Georgia proceedings will be livestreamed on YouTube and journalists will be allowed to use their phones in the courtroom. However, the juries will remain anonymous at least until the end of trial and will have security.In early September, while discussing whether all defendants could be tried together on the expedited date given to Chesebro and Powell, prosecutors estimated that a 19-defendant proceeding would involve a lengthy jury selection followed by a four-month trial that called 150 witnesses. Judge McAfee responded that he expected such a trial would take longer and later confirmed that the other defendants would not share Chesebro and Powell's trial date.Chesebro and Powell had been scheduled to be tried on October 23, and Judge McAfee had ordered that hundreds of potential jurors should appear beginning on October 20, but both defendants pleaded guilty shortly before juror selection began. During trial preparation, prosecutors had filed to seek testimony from Boris Epshteyn, Lin Wood, several GOP officials in other states, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones (whose attorney said he would plead the Fifth), and RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.Hall, Powell, Chesebro, and Ellis will not be tried because they have pleaded guilty. As of mid-October, trial dates for the others have not been set."
91,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Reactions,,"U.S. House Republicans opened an investigation into Willis hours before Trump surrendered for arrest. Congressman Jim Jordan wrote her asking if she had coordinated with the Smith special counsel investigation or used federal money in her investigation. Jordan demanded Willis provide documents and communications by September 7. Willis wrote to Jordan on September 7 that his letter contained ""inaccurate information and misleading statements,"" alleging he was seeking to ""obstruct a Georgia criminal proceeding and to advance outrageous misrepresentations"" without constitutional authority, for his personal political gain.Some Georgia Republican legislators, notably state senator Colton Moore, proposed convening a special legislative session to consider impeaching Willis. Such a move would require consent of Democrats, and Republican governor Brian Kemp said he opposed it to prevent ""political theater that only inflames the emotions of the moment"" and ""some grifter scam"" to raise campaign contributions for Moore.In May 2023, Georgia Republicans enacted a law that created a commission empowered to discipline or remove state prosecutors who were alleged to have violated their duties. As he signed the bill creating the commission, Governor Kemp said it would curb ""far-left prosecutors"" who are ""making our communities less safe."" Days after the Willis indictments, state senator Chad Dixon announced he would file a complaint against Willis when the commission commenced in October, alleging she had weaponized the justice system against political opponents with an ""unabashed goal to become some sort of leftist celebrity."" Hours after the commission became effective on October 1, eight Republican Georgia senators filed a complaint seeking to have Willis sanctioned for her alleged ""improperly cherry-picked cases to further her personal political agenda.""On September 14, 2023, one of the defendants, Jenna Ellis, said she would not support Trump for office again because he does not accept responsibility for his wrongdoings.On September 15, 2023, a three-judge panel ruled that Shawn Still would not lose his state senate seat as a result of the charges."
92,Georgia election racketeering prosecution,Notes,,
93,Gray Fire,Summary,,"The Gray Fire was a wildfire in Spokane County, Washington, United States. It began near Medical Lake at about 12:27 pm on August 18, 2023. As of September 1, 2023, the fire had burned 10,085 acres (4,081 ha) and was 100% contained. In addition to burning 259 structures, the death of one person was determined to be connected to the fire."
94,Gray Fire,History,August,"The Gray Fire began near Medical Lake at about 12:27 pm on August 18, 2023. The following day it grew to 9,500 acres (3,800 ha). That same day the fire reached 10% containment.On August 20, the burned area reached 10,014 acres (4,053 ha), while containment remained at 10%.On August 22, containment increased to 48% (mainly due in part to the rain that day which allowed authorities to evaluate damage to structures), while the burned area slightly increased to 10,016 acres (4,053 ha). Later the same day all evacuations in Medical Lake were lowered to Level 2 with only one area in the unincorporated area of Four Lakes still under a Level 3 evacuation. On August 24, containment further increased to 58%. Interstate 90 was re-opened on both sides. Washington State Route 904 and Washington State Route 902 were also re-opened that same day.

On August 27, containment reached 85% while the burned area remained the same. 
September 
On September 1, fire containment reached to 97% with the burned area remaining the same. Later that day, containment reached to 100%"
95,Gray Fire,Cause,,"The cause of the Gray Fire is suspected to be a faulty Inland Power and Light Company outdoor light. On September 26, 2023, two lawsuits had been filed against Inland Power and Light Company due to the devastation."
96,Gray Fire,Impact,Closures and evacuations,"Level 3 evacuation orders were issued for the city of Medical Lake and the unincorporated community of Four Lakes on August 18. Level 2 evacuations were also issued for the city of Cheney that same day. An evacuation shelter was opened at Spokane Falls Community College. National Guard troops were also called in to help evacuate patients and staff from Eastern State Hospital, a large psychiatric facility in Medical Lake.Interstate 90 from milepost 257 to milepost 270 and the entirery of State Route 902 were closed on August 18 due to the fire."

98,Gray Fire,Impact,Air Pollution,"Smoke primarily from wildfires burning in Canada, as well as the Gray Fire and two other fires in Spokane County caused Spokane, Washington to have the worst air quality in the United States for two days, on August 19 and August 20. Air quality index levels reached a peak level of 511 in Spokane in the morning of August 20."
99,Gray Fire,Impact,Political,"In response to the Gray Fire and 2 other fires, the Spokane County Board of Commissioners issued a county-wide state of emergency declaration for Spokane County allowing state and federal assistance to come into Spokane County. Washington Governor Jay Inslee also issued a state of emergency for the fires which allows further assistance along with the activation of the Washington National Guard to assist in containment of the fires.On August 20, the Washington state government's request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for a Fire Management Assistance Grant was approved. The grant provides federal funds primarily to help with various firefighting costs."
100,Tropical Storm Harold,Summary,,"Tropical Storm Harold was a moderate tropical storm that made landfall in South Texas in August 2023. The ninth named storm of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, Harold developed from a tropical wave that entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 20, after passing through the Bahamas and Straits of Florida. The system steadily organized over the following days, over record-warm sea-surface temperatures in the Gulf, as it progressed westward. Although the disturbance had not become organized enough to become a tropical cyclone yet, due to the threat it posed to southern Texas, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine on August 21. The disturbance organized into a tropical depression six hours later, before strengthening into a tropical storm the following morning and receiving the name Harold. Harold continued to strengthen as it moved quickly westward, and the cyclone made landfall on Padre Island, Texas, around 15:00 UTC on August 22, as a 50 mph (85 km/h) tropical storm. Harold quickly weakened as it moved inland over southern Texas and dissipated on August 23.
Harold led to severe wind gusts and significant rainfall as it struck Texas. Corpus Christi reported 5.25 in (133 mm) of rain from Harold, including a daily record of 4.74 in (120 mm) on August 22; similarly significant rainfall was reported in northern Mexico, peaking at 4 in (100 mm) in Piedras Negras in the state of Coahuila.  A modest storm surge of up to 2.2 ft (0.67 m) was reported at San Luis Pass. Wind gusts of up to 67 mph (108 km/h) affected the area, and over 35,000 electricity customers lost power during the storm. One school district in Texas had to shut down for several days following the storm due to the damage Harold inflicted on its classrooms."
101,Tropical Storm Harold,Meteorological history,,"An area of disturbed weather developed to the north of Hispaniola on August 17. The disturbance progressed westward, passing through The Bahamas and southern Florida over the following days, entering the Gulf of Mexico the morning of August 20. The developing system became better organized as it crossed the Gulf, but lacked sufficient organization to be deemed a tropical cyclone by late on August 21. Despite this, due to the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) expectation that the system would strengthen into a tropical storm and strike the Texas coast the next day, advisories were initiated on the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine at 15:00 UTC on August 21.
About six hours after being designated a potential tropical cyclone, an Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) discovered that the system had acquired a closed, well-defined center of circulation; it thus met the criteria of a tropical cyclone and was designated the ninth tropical depression of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season at 21:00 UTC that day. The newly formed cyclone continued to become better organized as it moved westward toward the Texas coast, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Harold at 6:00 UTC on August 22, as the broad storm's rain bands moved onshore. Shortly before landfall, Harold's center reformed to the north of its previous position, and the storm strengthened further to achieve its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 996 millibars. Harold made landfall on Padre Island, Texas by 15:00 UTC at peak intensity. Harold weakened quickly as it moved inland, dropping back to tropical depression status about six hours later, at which time the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) issued their own advisories for the storm from the NHC. Late that day, Tropical Depression Harold crossed into northern Mexico and continued to steadily weaken. The WPC issued its final advisory on Harold at 15:00 UTC on August 23 as its surface low became increasingly ill-defined and dissipated far inland over Mexico."
102,Tropical Storm Harold,Preparations and impact,Southwestern United States,"On August 21, upon Harold's precursor's designation as a potential tropical cyclone, a tropical storm warning was issued for much of the coast of southern Texas, from the mouth of the Rio Grande river, at the Texas-Mexico border, up to Port O'Connor, placing 1.3 million residents under the tropical storm warning, with rainfall anticipated to reach up to 7 in (180 mm). A Tropical Storm Watch was issued from north of Port O’Connor to Sargent. The Texas Division of Emergency Management, the state government's emergency management division, was deployed ahead of Harold's expected landfall, and the Texas State Emergency Operations Center was activated to Level II that day, indicating ""escalated response conditions"". Several school districts in multiple communities across the southern Texas coast were closed in advance of the storm for several days. City services in Corpus Christi were to remain in place during the storm, including public works and transportation. Residents across southern Texas were advised to prepare for the potential for flash flooding and tornadoes, while additional flood watches were issued further northwest into portions of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah.
Harold struck South Texas with strong winds and heavy rain as it moved across the region. A modest storm surge of 1.6–2.2 feet (0.67 m) was reported in areas including Port Lavaca, Galveston Bay, and San Luis Pass. Sustained winds of 36 mph (58 km/h), with stronger gusts of 59 mph (95 km/h), were reported at Corpus Christi International Airport, as well as 3.06 in (78 mm) of rainfall. Harold's rains were somewhat beneficial in certain areas of Southern Texas, which was in the midst of a moderate to severe drought before Harold's landfall. Harold dropped a total of 4.74 in (120 mm) of rain in a 24-hour period in Corpus Christi, setting a new daily rainfall record for the city, surpassing the previous record set by the much more powerful Hurricane Bret in 1999. Further, Corpus Christi was originally on track for one of its driest summers on record before Harold's landfall, but following the storm the city's summer rainfall rose above the seasonal average. Total rainfall from Harold reached 5.42 in (138 mm) in Corpus Christi and 5.15 in (131 mm) in Portland. Although Harold's maximum sustained winds only reached 50 mph (80 km/h), wind gusts of up to 67 mph (108 km/h) were reported at Loyola Beach, in addition to gusts of 65 mph (105 km/h) in Corpus Christi. Over 35,000 homes and business lost power due to Harold. No fatalities were reported from the storm.The remnants of Tropical Storm Harold also brought rainfall to Colorado, with 0.73 in (19 mm) of rain falling in Denver. The highest rainfall total in the state was 2.49 in (63 mm) in Nathrop. The storm brought the first Atlantic tropical rain in the state in 15 years. Moisture from Harold combining with the remnants of Eastern Pacific Hurricane Hilary also led to rainfall in parts of Arizona and Nevada."
103,Tropical Storm Harold,Preparations and impact,Mexico,"Moderate rainfall and gusty winds affected portions of the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Chihuahua, Nuevo León and Coahuila, although the strongest winds and heaviest flooding remained north of the states. The heaviest rainfall from Harold in Mexico occurred in the city of Piedras Negras in Coahuila,  with over 4 in (100 mm) falling in the area within a few hours. Overall damage from Harold was considered minor."
104,Tropical Storm Harold,Notes,,
105,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Summary,,"In early August 2023, a series of wildfires broke out in the U.S. state of Hawaii, predominantly on the island of Maui. The wind-driven fires prompted evacuations, caused widespread damage, killing at least 100 people and leaving four persons missing in the town of Lahaina on Maui's northwest coast. The proliferation of the wildfires was attributed to dry, gusty conditions created by a strong high-pressure area north of Hawaii and Hurricane Dora to the south.An emergency declaration was signed on August 8, authorizing several actions, including activation of the Hawaii National Guard, appropriate actions by the director of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency and the Administrator of Emergency Management, and the expenditure of state general revenue funds for relief of conditions created by the fires. By August 9, the state government of Hawaii issued a state of emergency for the entirety of the state. On August 10, U.S. President Joe Biden issued a federal major disaster declaration.For the Lahaina fire alone, the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimated that over 2,200 buildings had been destroyed, overwhelmingly residential and including many historic landmarks in Lahaina. The damage caused by the fire has been estimated at nearly $6 billion. In September 2023, the United States Department of Commerce published the official damage total of the wildfires as $5.5 billion (2023 USD)."
106,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Background,Wildfire risk,"The typical area burned by wildfires in Hawaii has increased in recent decades, almost quadrupling. Experts have blamed the increase on the spread of nonnative vegetation and hotter, drier weather due to climate change.During the 2010s and early 2020s, Clay Trauernicht, a botanist and fire scientist at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, and several other experts warned that the decline of agriculture in Hawaii meant that large areas of formerly productive land had been left unmanaged; nonnative invasive species like guinea grass were spreading rapidly and increasing the risk of large wildfires. The state government failed to provide incentives or impose mandates to keep land clear of grass.  The state government also did not require all structure owners to maintain defensible space, a standard rule in fire-prone states like California. The shrinking of the agricultural workforce reduced overall firefighting capacity; those workers had traditionally suppressed fires on the land they cared for, and were so effective that sometimes the counties called them for help. In 2022, Trauernicht suggested that Hawaii follow  Europe's example by subsidizing agriculture as a public good as a form of fire risk reduction.  In 2023, UH Manoa biogeography professor Camilo Mora estimated the cost of land restoration to mitigate wildfire risk at about $1 billion.  Despite these calls to action, the Hawaii State Legislature had been unable to make much progress; a 2022 bill to spend just $1.5 million on additional fire risk reduction measures died in a legislative committee.Around the time the fires occurred, twenty percent of the county of Maui was experiencing moderate drought (level 1 of 4), and sixteen percent of the county was under severe drought conditions (level 2 of 4). A decrease in rainfall consistent with the predicted impacts of climate change had also been recorded in the Hawaiian Islands, according to the U.S. National Climate Assessment. In the decades leading up to the fire, overdevelopment practices led to further water management challenges that reduced the availability of water for firefighting and exacerbated drought conditions.In June 2014, the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization, a nonprofit organization, prepared a Western Maui Community Wildfire Protection Plan which warned that most of the Lahaina area was at extremely high risk for burning.In Maui County's 2020 Hazard Mitigation Plan, the county identified Lahaina, the most heavily impacted community in the August fires, as lying within a high risk zone for wildfire.: 481–522 In its monthly seasonal outlook on August 1, 2023, the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) forecast ""above normal"" potential for significant wildland fires for Hawaii in August, concentrated on the islands' leeward sides. In addition to noting plentiful vegetation growth from the previous wet season and the expanding drought, the NIFC mentioned that ""tropical cyclones can also bring windy and dry conditions depending on how they approach the island chain and can exacerbate fire growth potential"".: 1, 2, 7 The vulnerability of the islands to deadly wildfires was gravely underestimated in long term assessments. A year prior, the State of Hawaii Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan Report had detailed wildfire risks as one of the lowest threats for the state. A 2021 Maui County assessment acknowledged the spike of wildfires in the state, but described funds as ""inadequate"" and heavily criticized the county fire department's strategic plan, claiming it said ""nothing about what can and should be done to prevent fires."""
107,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Background,Weather factors,"In early August 2023, a high-pressure system remained north of the Hawaiian Islands. This formed strong surface pressure north of the islands, and also sustained stabilization across the region, creating warm and sunny conditions. Concurrently, Hurricane Dora began to intensify to Category 4 strength, which may have helped to create a large pressure difference between the high-pressure area and the low-pressure cyclone. This pressure difference would have aided in already significant trade winds moving southwest, and formed strong gradient winds over the islands. (A similar phenomenon occurred during the October 2017 Portugal wildfires during the passage of Hurricane Ophelia.) The exact significance of Hurricane Dora and how it impacted the fires themselves remains somewhat unclear. Meteorologists noted that the storm's center remained more than 700 miles (1,100 km) from the islands and that it remained relatively small in size; however it also remained ""remarkably potent for a long time"", logging more hours as a Category 4 hurricane than any other storm in the Pacific for over 50 years. Philippe Papin, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, argued that Hurricane Dora played only a minor role in ""enhancing low-level flow over Maui at fire initiation time.""By August 6, the National Weather Service identified a region of very dry air arriving from the East Pacific, greatly inhibiting the potential for rainfall. A prominent descending capping inversion forced even more stabilization of the atmosphere, which led to enhanced wind gusts and very dry conditions between August 7 and 8. As the day progressed, deep layer ridging combined with the existing pressure gradient created very strong wind gusts and caused humidity levels to be well below normal. The aforementioned cap was expected to only strengthen acceleration of wind due to terrain features near the islands."
108,2023 Hawaii wildfires,List of wildfires,,
109,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Timeline,Maui,"On August 4, 2023, at 11:01 a.m. HST (UTC 21:01), the first of many small fires ignited on Maui. A 30-acre brush fire was reported adjacent to the Kahului Airport in a field. By 9:29 p.m. HST (UTC 07:29), the fire was reported 90% contained, but many flights out of the airport were delayed to August 11.On August 8, 2023, intense winds knocked down numerous utility poles. By 4:55 p.m. HST (UTC 02:55), ""about 30 downed poles"" had been reported on Maui, resulting in ""at least 15 separate outages impacting more than 12,400 customers"". By that time, there had been no power in some parts of West Maui since 4:50 a.m. HST (UTC 14:50). Downed power lines are being investigated as a factor in igniting the fires, having been captured on video."
110,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Timeline,Hawaiʻi Island,"In Hawaiʻi County, neighborhoods in the North and South Kohala districts of the Island of Hawaiʻi were evacuated due to rapidly spreading brush fires. On August 9, several other brush fires broke out near the communities of Nā'ālehu and Pāhala; those fires were quickly brought under control. Hawaiʻi County Mayor Mitch Roth said there were no reports of injuries or destroyed homes on the Big Island."
111,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Timeline,Oʻahu,"On August 16, a large brushfire sprung up on the outskirts of Wahiawā on Oʻahu. Though it did not burn near any houses, the fire threatened local unhoused people as well as the Kūkaniloko Birth Site, a location registered under the National Register of Historic Places and near-thousand year old site that is the location of the births of Hawaiian chiefs."
112,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Impact,Casualties,"As of November 14, 2023, there were 100 confirmed deaths, and four individuals are unaccounted for due to the Lahaina fire on Maui. As of November 14, 97 of the victims have been identified. Among the dead was confirmed to be a Filipino national who was a naturalized U.S. citizen. The death toll in West Maui made it the deadliest wildfire and natural disaster ever recorded in Hawaii since statehood with potential to double or triple in the near future; Hawaii's governor warned that ""10 to 20"" bodies may be found per day during the search, which was expected to last approximately ten more days.As of August 18, at least 67 people were injured in the fires. On August 9, at least twenty individuals were reported hospitalized at a Maui hospital. Six additional individuals, three of whom had critical burns, were reportedly transported by air ambulance from Maui to hospitals on Oʻahu.On August 17, 60 survivors were found alive sheltering inside a single home.Due to DNA testing determining that victims were unintentionally being counted multiple times, the death toll officially dropped from 115 to 97 on September 18th."
113,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Impact,Damage,"The main Maui wildfire burned much of the community of Lahaina, where more than 2,200 structures were damaged or destroyed, including much of the downtown Lahaina Historic District centered on Front Street. 96% of burned structures were residential. The 3.4-square-mile  area (8.8 km2) was the commercial, residential, and cultural center of the community. On August 17, Governor Green noted that the fire temperature had reached 1,000 °F (538 °C), since it was hot enough to melt granite counters and engine blocks.  Puddles of melted aluminum have been seen underneath burned-out vehicles.Although PDC and FEMA had initially estimated total damage at around $5.52 billion, catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Co. estimated on August 16 that insured property losses would be only $3.2 billion. Real estate experts expressed concern that many Lahaina homes were uninsured or underinsured and surviving owners might not have sufficient financial resources to build new homes in compliance with the state's current building code.  Many Native Hawaiians were able to afford to live in Lahaina only because they had inherited paid-off homes from previous generations, and since they had not needed mortgage loans to purchase their homes, they were not required to carry homeowners insurance coverage.The Lahaina Historic District, which was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1962 and was the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii for 35 years, suffered extensive fire damage. Among the structures destroyed were:

The Waiola Church, which celebrated its 200th anniversary in May 2023, lost its main sanctuary, annex, and social hall. Waiola Church's cemetery is the burial ground for members of the Hawaiian Royal Family, including Queen Keōpūolani, who founded the church in 1823.
The Lahaina Jodo Mission, a Buddhist temple in northern Lahaina. Established in 1912 and stood on its current location since 1932.
The Pioneer Inn, a landmark town hotel constructed by George Alan Freeland in 1901.
The Nā ʻAikāne Cultural Center, a local cultural center which once housed a soup kitchen for striking plantation workers during an International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) strike against the Pioneer Mill.
The Old Lahaina Courthouse, which first operated in 1860 as a customs house for trade and whaling ships. The building's roof was completely destroyed. The Old Lahaina Courthouse stands in heavily damaged Lahaina Banyan Court Park.
The Lahaina Heritage Museum and its collection, which were housed inside the Old Courthouse building, were also destroyed. The collection included items that spanned Lahaina's history, including artifacts from the area's ancient Hawaiian period, the Hawaiian Kingdom and monarchy, the plantation period, and the town's whaling era. Copies of the museum's documents had been digitized and stored online prior to the fire.
The Baldwin Home Museum, which was constructed in 1834 and 1835 as the home of American missionaries Dwight Baldwin and Charlotte Fowler Baldwin, burned to the ground. The Baldwin Home was the oldest house on the island of Maui. Historic items lost in the house fire included Baldwin's medical instruments he used to vaccinate much of Maui's population against smallpox in the 1800s, seashell collections, and the family's furniture and rocking chairs from the East Coast.
The Wo Hing Society Hall, built in the early 1910s to serve the growing Chinese population in Lahaina. It was restored and turned into the Wo Hing Museum in the 1980s.The fire also destroyed several cell towers in affected areas, causing service outages and 9-1-1 emergency telephone services to be rendered unavailable. The wildfire that burned near the community of Kula, located in Maui's Upcountry, destroyed at least two homes.The Maria Lanakila Catholic Church in Lahaina, which had been dedicated in 1858. Contrary to early reports, the main church building and steeple were not destroyed and survived the fire largely intact, though the roof and interior may have sustained some damage.The Lahaina Civic Center, venue for the Maui Invitational Tournament, a prominent early-season college men's basketball event, has so far escaped significant damage, although it had to be evacuated after earlier serving as an evacuation center. The 2023 tournament, scheduled for November, will be moved to Honolulu at the Stan Sheriff Center instead."
114,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Impact,Environment,"Lahaina's famous banyan tree, the largest banyan tree in the United States, had most of its foliage charred, though was left standing after the fire. A video taken on August 11 showed local officials watering the tree to aid its recovery. At least some green foliage appeared to be present and the roots, trunks, and branches of the tree were largely undamaged.On August 11, unsafe water alerts were issued as early as 3 p.m. (01:00 UTC) warning residents of Lahaina and Upper Kula, with instructions to not drink or use tap water for daily activities, even after boiling, and all residents were requested to limit water use. Following earlier deployments on August 9, further potable water tankers were set up at locations across the island. Some scientists have also warned that charred soils, toxic contaminated top soil and other debris could run off into the shoreline and cause marine habitats and coral to be damaged."
115,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Impact,Evacuations,"The fires prompted mass evacuations of thousands of residents and visitors from Lāhaina, Kāʻanapali, Kīhei, and Kula. The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed that they had rescued 17 people who had jumped into the sea in Lahaina to escape the fires. As of August 12, more than 1,400 people on Maui remained in shelters. Vacationing San Francisco mayor London Breed was among those evacuated from Maui.An estimated 11,000 people flew out of Maui via Kahului Airport on August 9, 2023.American, Southwest, Hawaiian, and Alaska Airlines had added additional flights to their routes into Kahului Airport by August 10 to help evacuate people from the island, and American replaced a narrow-body Airbus A321 with a wide-body Boeing 777 to further boost capacity. All four airlines had also reportedly waived fare cancellation penalties and fare-difference fees for affected passengers, and Hawaiian and Southwest offered temporary $19 interisland flights until August 11.  By August 13, 2023, over 46,000 visitors had flown out of Maui via Kahului Airport.Hawaiian state officials created plans to house visitors along with thousands of displaced Maui residents at the Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu, Oʻahu and over 100 had stayed as of August 10.After the fire swept through Lahaina on August 8, Maui County blocked public access to all of West Maui with checkpoints on Route 30/340 (Honoapiʻilani Highway, the only highway in and out of the area). Over the next three days, the blockade created a desperate situation for residents of still-intact communities who ran low on medicine, food, and fuel, while other residents and tourists who suddenly found themselves outside of the blockade wished to retrieve their belongings. On August 11, 2023, the County reopened the checkpoint on Route 30 at Māʻalaea to help ameliorate these issues. Within five hours, the checkpoint was closed again, reportedly because of attempts to enter the sealed-off portion of Lahaina.On September 25 officials cleared a small area in North Lahaina for reentry, the first time in over 6 weeks that residents had been allowed back into the city. Visiting residents were provided with personal protective equipment and urged not to disturb the ash, which may contain hazardous materials such as asbestos and lead."
116,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Impact,Wildlife and pets,"The Maui Humane Society stated that there is an estimated 3,000 animals from Lahaina that were currently missing after the fires as of August 16. As of August 14, the society had received about 367 lost animal reports and some dual reported with the society and on the ""Missing Pets of Maui"" Facebook page created by the society which has about 6,400 members. Any found animals are checked for any identification and scanned for a microchip, with the society urging that found deceased animals should not be moved or destroyed so that they can be cataloged and checked for any identification.Animal welfare advocates and the Maui Police were working in tandem to search the burned areas for lost, injured or deceased animals, with dozens of feeding and drinking stations set up to draw out animals. After the fire in order to make room for animals that were impacted by the fires, the Humane Society, and the only open-admission animal shelter on the island airlifted over 100 shelter animals to Portland, Oregon. Veterinarians and staff members of the Kīhei Veterinary Clinic, the Humane Society, and the Central Maui Animal Clinic and volunteers coordinated care for the found animals as well as disbursing free medical care, food and animal medication to island residents. Donations and care were also extended to the Maui Police Department's K-9 unit that are working with recovery efforts and housing for the animals.Scientists with the National Science Foundation and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began to prep for studies that would monitor and document any changes in water quality due to soil erosion and other effects of the fire that can affect the island's waterways and ecosystems. Others expressed thanks that areas such as the Maui Bird Conservation Center was spared from the majority of the fires, as it housed a large portion of the alalā flock."
117,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Legal proceedings,,"Within two weeks of the Maui wildfires, lawyers from California, Florida, Oregon, Texas, and Washington had come to Maui to sign up wildfire victims as plaintiffs. Chief Disciplinary Counsel Bradley Tamm (the state's primary lawyer regulator) warned Hawaiians to be careful: ""It’s a feeding frenzy. There are sharks both in the water and on the land"". Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc., the primary electric utility for Maui, became a significant focus of such litigation. By August 14, at least one lawsuit had been filed against Hawaiian Electric, and the company experienced a decline in its stock value.On August 9, 2023, a deputy attorney general representing the Board of Land and Natural Resources filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to the Hawai'i Supreme Court, alleging that a Hawaii circuit court judge's rulings regarding private water usage had restricted the amount of water available to fight the fires. This claim was disputed by the responding Sierra Club, who requested the Supreme Court to sanction the Attorney General for filing the petition under false pretenses. The attorney representing Maui County stated during the hearing that a lack of water was never an issue during the wildfires. The Supreme Court denied the petition.On October 4, 2023,  a filing with the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission showed that Hawaiian Electric was underinsured against its potential liability exposure for the Maui wildfires, with only about $165 million in liability insurance coverage. According to ALM's Law.com, as of October 5, 2023, more than 35 lawsuits had been filed against Hawaiian Electric and other defendants. Most but not all had been filed in Hawaii state circuit courts, especially the Second Circuit based in Wailuku (which has jurisdiction over Maui County).  In response, Hawaiian Electric retained California law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson as its lead defense counsel. The same law firm had previously worked for Pacific Gas and Electric on litigation arising out of the 2018 California wildfires, in which its attorneys had billed their time in 2019 at rates between $400 and $1,400 per hour."
118,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Response,Federal government,"U.S. President Joe Biden ordered the mobilization of ""all available federal assets"" to help respond to the wildfires. In a statement, Biden noted that the United States Navy Third Fleet and the United States Coast Guard were supporting ""response and rescue efforts"". The United States Department of Transportation was working with commercial airlines to help evacuate tourists from Maui. To help with the ongoing Coast Guard search and rescue operation, the United States Navy sent in Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron Three Seven (HSM-37) and two MH-60R Seahawk helicopters, with the United States Indo-Pacific Command standing ready to provide additional assistance as needed. Meanwhile, the U.S. 25th Infantry Division from Schofield Barracks on Oʻahu was deployed alongside the Hawaii National Guard to Maui and Hawaii Island to assist with fire suppression support, search and rescue operations, and traffic control.President Biden approved the state of Hawaii's request for a major disaster declaration on August 10, making federal funding available for recovery efforts in the affected areas. On August 10, FEMA initiated deployment of Urban Search and Rescue Task Force personnel from around the United States to Maui. Washington State Task Force 1 sent 45 specialists along with a 5-member K-9 team. Each human member of the K-9 team works with a canine partner, a FEMA-certified human remains detection dog. The same task force had previously deployed to Maui in 2018 to assist with the aftermath of Hurricane Lane. On August 10, Nevada Task Force 1 was initially asked to send one K-9 handler and dog, who left that same day. The request was amended to four more specialists, then on top of that, a full 45-member task force team, all of whom flew out on August 11.FEMA initially provided $700 payments as one of several types of federal assistance available to survivors of the wildfire, which was meant to address immediate needs such as food, water, and clothing.California sent 11 members of Urban Search and Rescue task forces based in the cities of Sacramento, Riverside, and Oakland, and six employees of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services. On August 15, California announced that it was increasing its deployment to 101 people, including an incident management team of 67 Cal Fire employees.  Among the new personnel arriving on Maui were forensic anthropologists from Chico State who had helped identify victims of the Camp Fire (2018).By August 16, the number of FEMA cadaver dogs deployed to the scene had increased to 40, and Governor Green explained that the searchers were in a ""race against time"" to recover remains before they could be degraded by the next rainstorm.  Each dog could only work for about 15 to 20 minutes in the tropical heat before rotating into an air-conditioned truck to cool down. The dogs also had to wear booties to shield their paws from asphalt temperatures exceeding 150 °F (66 °C) and still-hot embers, but the booties themselves required frequent replacement.Meanwhile, on August 15, a federal Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team (DMORT) arrived on the island to assist with the identification and processing of the large number of remains. The DMORT brought along a portable morgue in the form of 22.5 short tons (20,400 kg) of equipment and supplies, and nine Matson shipping containers were seen outside the Maui Police Department's Forensic Facility in Wailuku.On August 17, a five-member National Response Team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrived on Maui to investigate the cause and origin of the Lahaina fire.  The team included an electrical engineer from the Fire Research Laboratory.On August 21, President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden arrived at Kahului Airport, where they met with Governor Josh Green, his wife Jaime, as well as members of Hawaii's congressional delegation. The Bidens then boarded Marine One where they were given an aerial tour of the devastation.  Biden then went to Lahaina where he met with first responders as well as local and state officials and FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell. The Bidens walked through the ruins of the town seeing the area firsthand. They also took part in a blessing by island elders. Biden then spoke to the community and met with survivors at the Lahaina Civic Center.By August 25, the FEMA Urban Search and Rescue task forces had searched 99% of the disaster area, and they wrapped up their work and returned home to the mainland United States."
119,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Response,State government,"Hawaii Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke, who was serving as acting governor in the absence of Governor Josh Green while he was traveling outside of Hawaii, issued an emergency proclamation and activated the Hawaii National Guard. The Hawaii National Guard, together with the U.S. 25th Infantry Division from Schofield Barracks on Oʻahu, deployed to Maui and Hawaii Island to assist with fire suppression support, search and rescue operations, and traffic control. Two UH-60 Blackhawk and one CH-47 Chinook helicopters were also deployed to support fire suppression efforts.As of August 9, 2023, the Hawaii Tourism Authority was asking all visitors on Maui for non-essential travel to leave the island and strongly discouraged any further non-essential travel to the island.Previously closed to prioritize emergency services, access to West Maui via Honoapiʻilani Highway for residents with proof of residency and visitors with proof of hotel reservations was resumed beginning at 12 p.m. (UTC 22:00) on August 11. However, at 4 p.m. (UTC 02:00) access was again restricted due to reports of people accessing restricted areas despite hazardous conditions. Access was reopened the following day through Waihee (from the north) only.On August 11, Hawaii Attorney General Anne Lopez announced that her department would conduct a ""comprehensive review of critical decision-making and standing policies"" surrounding the wildfires.On August 16, Governor Josh Green announced his intention to create a moratorium on the sale of land damaged and destroyed by the fires. While acknowledging there may be legal challenges to such a moratorium, he asked ""please don't approach them with an offer to buy land. Please don't approach their families to tell them that they are going to be better off if they make a deal, because we're not going to allow it.""On August 31, Attorney General Lopez disclosed in an interview that her office had hired UL's Fire Safety Research Institute to conduct an independent investigation on behalf of the state government, and the UL investigators had been on scene in Maui since August 24."
120,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Response,International assistance,
121,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Response,Fundraising and donations,"Due to multiple GoFundMe fundraising efforts for those that were affected by the fires, the site put together a hub to gather all of the verified fundraisers, and added that by August 18 there had been more than 250,000 donors and $30 million raised through the site for those affected. Other organizations, communities and businesses across the United States held donation drives and fundraisers where proceeds and the items would be donated to specific nonprofits or groups. All twelve professional sports teams from the Los Angeles area donated $450,000 to relief efforts. In addition, proceeds from the October 8 preseason game at the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Utah Jazz will go towards the Maui Strong Fund.The Hawaiian Mission Houses Archives has uploaded items to their digitization project relevant to Lahaina's history such as photos, journals, drawings, and letters to aid in the recovery of historic sites."
122,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Response,Concerns about preparedness,"A lack of adequate warning and preparation has also come into focus. Despite Hawaii's advanced integrated outdoor siren warning system, on Maui, 80 of these sirens, designed for tsunamis and other disasters, remained silent as the fires burned. The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency attributed the lack of activation to the fires' rapid progression and existing ground response coordination. And while residents received other alerts, such as mobile phone notifications, the intensity and urgency of these messages were deemed insufficient. At least one analyst compared them unfavorably to high-priority tsunami warnings, suggesting a possible alarm fatigue among residents, where frequent, less urgent alerts can diminish the perceived significance of real threats. The administrator of the Maui County Emergency Management Agency, Herman Andaya, defended the decision not to activate the emergency sirens in an August 16 press conference; he argued that the outdoor sirens exist only on the coastline and are normally used to warn residents to flee tsunamis by heading to the mountainside, which would have sent them straight into the fire. Andaya resigned the next day effective immediately, citing health reasons.The Lahaina wildfires also exposed gaps in the state's wildfire preparedness. In a 2021 report, Hawaii officials ranked wildfire risk as ""low"" despite increasing fire acreage and dangers from drought and non-native grasses. The report criticized inadequate funding and lack of fire prevention strategies. Previous wildfires served as a warning, but risks were not adequately addressed. Hawaii's fire management budgets had not kept pace with growing threats, according to the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization. Non-native, flammable grasses remained widespread, increasing fire risk. The climatologist Abby Frazier emphasized Hawaii's extreme wildfire vulnerability and called for more serious fire prevention efforts. The 2021 Maui County report had recommended fire hazard risk assessment and replacing non-native grasses, but it is unclear if these recommendations were implemented.A state official for the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources delayed the request of the release of water by the West Maui Land Co. to protect its holdings until it was too late. In early September, it was reported that residents of numerous communities around the state of Hawaii had become deeply worried about the risk of losing their own homes to wildfires, after seeing how Lahaina had been so suddenly destroyed."
123,2023 Hawaii wildfires,Response,Conspiracy theories,"Following the fires, a variety of conspiracy theories about them were posted to social media, notably by far-right conspiracy theorist Stew Peters. Some contained doctored images or images and videos of other unrelated events presented as being from the fires, often ostensibly demonstrating that a directed-energy weapon or ""space laser"" was involved. There have also been mentions of famous individuals' estates in Hawaii that have not been damaged from the fires, prompting unsubstantiated accusations of blame. Other posts have claimed that wildfires do not occur naturally or that vegetation is not left standing in a natural fire. Real Raw News, a fake news website, promoted falsehoods about U.S. Marines attacking a FEMA convoy fleeing the wildfires and arresting FEMA deputy administrator Erik Hooks.Researchers from Microsoft, Recorded Future, the RAND Corporation, NewsGuard and the University of Maryland found that a Chinese government-directed disinformation campaign used the disaster to attempt to sow discord in the US. Lahaina residents were discouraged from going to the agencies for assistance by disinformation from people who regularly spread Russian propaganda."

125,Hurricane Hilary,Summary,,"Hurricane Hilary was a large, potent Category 4 Pacific hurricane in August 2023 which brought torrential rainfall and gusty winds to the Pacific Coast of Mexico, the Baja California Peninsula and the Southwestern United States, resulting in widespread flooding and numerous mudslides. Hilary broke records in four U.S. states for wettest tropical cyclone or its remnants.
The eighth named storm, sixth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season, Hilary originated from a disturbance south of Mexico associated with a tropical wave that entered the Pacific Ocean from Central America on August 12. The disturbance gradually grew more organized, and was named Tropical Storm Hilary while off the coast of Manzanillo, Colima, on August 16. Hilary quickly strengthened into a hurricane the next day. While tracking west-northwestward on August 17 and 18, it underwent rapid intensification, reaching its peak as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) and a central pressure of 939 mbar (27.7 inHg). The cyclone then quickly weakened the following day due to the effects of cooler sea surface temperatures, drier air, and increasing wind shear. After weakening into a tropical storm, Hilary made landfall in San Quintín, Baja California, at 18:00 UTC on August 20, about 215 mi (345 km) south-southeast of San Diego, California. It then tracked northward into California, retaining its tropical characteristics through the morning of August 21. It then transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone while over the southern San Joaquin Valley. Hilary was the first tropical storm to enter California since Nora in 1997.In anticipation of ""catastrophic and life-threatening flooding"", the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued its first-ever tropical storm warning for Southern California, extending from the Mexico–United States border to just north of Los Angeles. Persistent heavy rainfall, potentially ""more than a year’s worth of rain"" in some areas, was forecasted. Due to this, flood watches were issued, affecting about 26 million people across four states (Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah), and the entire region was placed under a high risk threat for flash flooding by the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).Two fatalities, both in Mexico, have been linked to Hilary. Additionally, the storm left behind flooded roads, mudslides and downed trees in the Baja California peninsula and in Southern California. Even so, its overall impact on the region was less severe than initially feared."
126,Hurricane Hilary,Meteorological history,,"On August 12, a tropical wave traversing Central America producing widespread rain showers and thunderstorms entered the far eastern Pacific. A broad area of low pressure developed within the wave on August 14, off the southern coasts of Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador. The disturbance gradually became better organized during the following day, and a well-defined circulation along with developing convective banding features were observed on the morning of August 16, thus prompting the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify it as Tropical Storm Hilary. Convection near the storm's center increased throughout the day, dense overcast started to develop over the growing storm as a result, and an eye began to form at its center. Consequently, Hilary quickly strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on August 17, while located about 320 mi (515 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. Deep convection intensified beneath the system's cloud tops, which had cooled to below −112 °F (−80 °C), and its expanding upper-level outflow pattern became symmetric. Hilary continued to rapidly intensify, reaching Category 4 strength at 06:00 UTC on August 18.
By 15:00 UTC that day, Hilary's intensity leveled off with peak sustained winds at 145 mph (230 km/h), an increase of 80 mph (130 km/h) over a 24‑hour period. Hilary benefited from exceptional conditions during its intensification phase, with sea-surface temperatures of near 86 °F (30 °C), low wind shear, and high relative humidity levels. A hurricane hunter flight later that day confirmed that Hilary was a Category 4 hurricane, though not as strong as expected, with maximum sustained winds determined to be at 130 mph (215 km/h). The hurricane initially tracked west-northwestward, then toward the northwest during this time, responding to the steering influences of a trough of low pressure to its north near the California coast and a ridge of high pressure over the central United States. As those influences began drawing Hilary north-northwestward on the morning of August 19, asymmetrical convective patterns developed as the deep convection on the west side of the system was being eroded by an intrusion of dry and stable air. This caused the hurricane to weaken to Category 3 strength, with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). By the end of that day, the hurricane had dropped to Category 1 as a result of the adverse effects of cooler waters, drier air, and increasing shear. At around 10:30 UTC the eye of the storm briefly touched the mainland at Punta Eugenia, Baja California Sur, before passing over the nearby inhabited islands of Natividad and Cedros.Hilary made landfall at around 18:00 UTC on August 20, with sustained winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) in San Quintín, Baja California, or about 215 mi (345 km) south-southeast of San Diego, California. The storm continued to move north-northwestward after landfall, and crossed into California about six hours later, south-southwest of Palm Springs. Late that day, the storm's low-level center became increasingly diffused and more difficult to track, eventually briefly reconsolidating along the coast of south-central Los Angeles. On the morning of August 21, while moving over the southern San Joaquin Valley, Hilary became a post-tropical cyclone. Its upper level remnants then tracked north into the Rocky Mountains due to a jet stream."
127,Hurricane Hilary,Preparations,Mexico,"The Mexican government issued watches for southern Baja California Sur on August 17. They were upgraded to warnings later that day. Hurricane watches were issued for western parts of the Baja California peninsula at 03:00 UTC on August 18, and by 15:00 UTC the same day, they were upgraded to hurricane warnings as hurricane watches were issued for the west coast of Baja California.Ports were closed to navigation along the Pacific coast from Oaxaca to Colima on August 17. School classes and public activities were cancelled in Baja California, and in Baja California Sur, a baseball game was postponed and ports along the state's coast were closed. Several schools in Cabo San Lucas were used as temporary shelters, and 18,000 soldiers were on alert. In La Paz, law enforcement patrolled closed beaches, while schools in five municipalities were shut down. Around 20 flights were cancelled at Los Cabos International Airport. Tijuana and Ensenada closed their beaches August 19. Across five islands in the hurricane's path, 850 people were evacuated."
128,Hurricane Hilary,Preparations,United States,"On August 18, the NHC issued its first-ever tropical storm watch for Southern California, and a level 4/high risk for excessive rainfall was issued by the Weather Prediction Center. This became the first ever high risk of flash flooding in the desert valleys of Southern California east of the Peninsular Ranges. A flood watch was also issued for portions of California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. Twelve hours later, the NHC upgraded the tropical storm watch to a tropical storm warning for the region. On August 19, the level 4/high risk from the Weather Prediction Center was continued and expanded.Amtrak cancelled its August 19 run of the westbound Sunset Limited due to the storm; the eastbound August 20 run was also cancelled with its Texas Eagle attachment originating in San Antonio. They also truncated the August 19 runs of westbound Southwest Chief and the southbound Coast Starlight to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Emeryville, California, respectively. The August 20 runs of these two trains going eastbound and westbound respectively would also originate from these locations. Numerous Pacific Surfliner trains were also cancelled, forced to run on modified schedules, or delayed between August 19–21 as well. Parts of Joshua Tree National Park, Death Valley National Park, Mojave National Preserve, and Lake Mead are closed. The Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation announced that all parks and facilities were closed on Sunday and Monday. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department advised all people to leave Catalina Island on August 19 and Avalon Bay was closed to boats and ships. Additional resources were deployed to the island by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the Los Angeles County Fire Department. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department issued evacuation warnings for Oak Glen, Forest Falls, Mountain Home Village, Angelus Oaks and northeast Yucaipa also on August 19. Evacuation warnings were also issued for Orange County, including areas near the Bond Fire scar. The launch for Falcon 9 and Starlink satellites from Vandenberg Space Force Base near Los Angeles was postponed by SpaceX. An emergency operations center was opened in San Diego and Los Angeles. Southwest Airlines flights departing from Palm Springs International Airport were cancelled. Other airports in the region that had flights affected include Los Angeles, Bakersfield, Burbank, Long Beach, Ontario, Orange County, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and San Diego. DoorDash suspended operations in numerous areas across southern California.
Major League Baseball rescheduled three games in advance of Hilary: one each for the San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Los Angeles Angels. Major League Soccer home games for the LA Galaxy and Los Angeles FC were also rescheduled. However, the National Football League did not cancel a Los Angeles Chargers preseason game at SoFi Stadium. Del Mar Racetrack canceled the race meeting scheduled on August 20. This is only the second time in the 84-year track's history that such a cancellation occurred. In addition, no live audience was permitted to attend the August 20 games for VALORANT Champions Los Angeles at the Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall. The United States Navy moved carriers and ships out to sea and out of Hilary's path, including the USS Theodore Roosevelt, and to park aircraft in hangars. Federal Emergency Management Agency staff and personnel were ordered to be positioned in southern California by President Joe Biden, and Biden urged residents and people in the storm's path to take precautions. Nevada governor Joe Lombardo deployed 100 National Guard and Nevada National Guard troops to assist southern Nevada impacted by severe weather associated with Hilary. Lombardo also declared a state of emergency, along with emergencies in Clark and Nye counties. California governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for southern California. The California National Guard preemptively deployed to multiple locations across southern California on August 19. The American Red Cross opened shelters in Imperial, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties. Emergency shelters were also opened by local governments in Yucca Valley and Twentynine Palms.Ongoing strikes by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA were cancelled for Monday in Los Angeles in preparation for Hilary. A concert at the Hollywood Bowl was postponed, and all Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation areas were closed. Disneyland and Disney California Adventure were closed early. Legoland California, SeaWorld San Diego and San Diego Zoo were closed on August 20. The Los Angeles Zoo, Six Flags Magic Mountain, and Knott's Berry Farm were also closed. California State University, Los Angeles and California State University, Fullerton canceled classes on August 21. All campuses in the Bear Valley Unified School District were closed on August 21. Numerous airlines offered travel waivers to airports in southern California. Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass signed a local emergency declaration on August 19. On August 20, 2023, the Los Angeles Unified School District announced that campuses would be closed the following day. Several schools in Orange County were closed. Fullerton College was closed as well, and schools across the Anaheim Union High School District, Anaheim Elementary School District, and the South Orange County Community College District were also closed.On August 20, the Storm Prediction Center issued a level 2/slight risk in Southern California, which included 5% risk of tornadoes. The Weather Prediction Center also continued the level 4/high risk, with forecaster David Roth stating that ""the 00z NAM CONEST advertises local amounts of 17 inches (430 mm)+, which would be exceedingly rare, bordering on unique, for the region from a tropical cyclone and unique for Nevada, which had its first ever High Risk WPC Day issued for the state. The 100 year ARI is forecast to be exceeded over a broad area."" At 16:00 UTC, the Weather Prediction Center changed its outlook slightly, noting that model guidance indicated the chance for 5 inches (130 mm) of rainfall in the mountains of Idaho from the system."
129,Hurricane Hilary,Impact,Mexico,"Heavy rains from the developing storm affected portions of southern and western Mexico. Coastal areas of Sinaloa recorded torrential rains from the hurricane's passage, with its first fatality reported on August 18 in Navolato when an SUV and its driver were washed away. On August 28, the government of Baja California Sur calculated the damage statewide to be 250 million pesos (US$14.7 million).On the Baja California peninsula, nearly 1,900 people were evacuated to shelters. Torrential rainfall caused widespread flooding and landslides in Baja California Sur. One man died in Santa Rosalía, when his vehicle was washed away by floodwaters. Officials in Baja California reported numerous mud and rock slides across the state along with several power outages."
130,Hurricane Hilary,Impact,United States,"According to catastrophe modeler Karen Clark & Company, insurance losses reached US$600 million across the Western United States. Damages in the US alone were estimated at US$675 million by professional services company Aon in October 2023.Wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 km/h) were widespread across Southern California as Hilary passed through. The strongest gusts were recorded in Los Angeles County – 87 mph (140 km/h) at Magic Mountain, and San Diego County – 84 mph (135 km/h) at Big Black Mountain. On August 20, downtown Los Angeles and San Diego each recorded its wettest single summer day on record (June through August) with 2.48 in (63 mm) and 1.82 in (46 mm) of precipitation respectively. Palm Springs recorded 3.18 in (81 mm), also a single summer day record amount. Rainfall at Furnace Creek in Death Valley totaled 2.20 in (56 mm), setting a new single-day rainfall record; the amount was more than the annual average rainfall of 2.15 in (55 mm). The highest rain totals were recorded in the San Bernardino Mountains – 11.73 in (298 mm) at Raywood Flats, and the San Jacinto Mountains – 11.74 in (298 mm) at Mount San Jacinto.In California, portions of I-8, I-10, I-15, SR 14, and the Pacific Coast Highway closed due to flooding and rockslides. All roads in Death Valley National Park were severely damaged by flash flooding, forcing a two-month shutdown of the entire park. Floodwaters entered Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, but this did not impact operations there. 9-1-1 lines were down in Palm Springs, Cathedral City, and Indio. Vehicles were inundated in Palm Springs, and Coachella Valley. Local states of emergency were declared in Palm Springs and in Indio. A tornado warning was issued for Alpine and Descanso, in San Diego County. Water rescues occurred across the San Diego area. At least 1,000 flights were cancelled and 3,700 were delayed across the region. More than 5,000 customers were left without electricity according to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Also, an August 21 Major League Baseball game scheduled for Angel Stadium in Anaheim was postponed due to the wet conditions at the ballpark. The storm spawned a tornado in Fresno, which damaged dozens of trees and buildings.
The strongest winds beyond California primarily occurred in Nevada and Utah at high-elevation locations above 9,000 ft (2,700 m), with the weather station at Cardiff Pass (Utah) recording a gust of 75 mph (121 km/h). Records for wettest (total rainfall) tropical cyclones and their remnants were broken in four states: Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon. The new mark in Nevada is more than double the previous record. The resulting flash flooding there forced the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area to close indefinitely.Arizona received much less precipitation from Hilary than forecasted. In contrast to Nevada, where several locations received over 2 in (51 mm) of precipitation, only one did so in Arizona – Hilltop recorded (2.10 in (53 mm); most places received less than 1 in (25 mm)."
131,Hurricane Hilary,Impact,In popular culture,"Hilary's push toward Southern California coincided with a 5.1 magnitude earthquake that struck north of Los Angeles near Ojai, California, along with numerous aftershocks. Only minor damage and no injuries were reported from the quakes. As a result, the term ""hurriquake"" trended on social media."
132,Hurricane Hilary,Notes,,
133,Hurricane Idalia,Summary,,"Hurricane Idalia was a powerful and destructive Category 4 hurricane that caused significant damage across parts of the southeastern United States, especially in North Florida, in late August 2023. The tenth named storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, Idalia formed from a low-pressure area that crossed Central America from the eastern Pacific Ocean. Gradual development ensued as it meandered in the western part of the Caribbean Sea; the system was upgraded to a tropical depression on August 26, 2023, and strengthened into a tropical storm a day later, receiving the name Idalia. It traversed the Gulf of Mexico where it underwent rapid intensification, briefly becoming a Category 4 hurricane prior to making landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida at Category 3 strength on August 30. Idalia remained a hurricane as it moved through Northern Florida and crossed into Southeast Georgia; it then pushed into the Carolinas as a tropical storm. On August 31, Idalia emerged into the Atlantic, where it transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone that same day. Later, it passed south of Bermuda, made a counterclockwise loop, then meandered off the coast of Nova Scotia while winding down.
Idalia caused significant damage to thousands of homes, businesses, and other infrastructure along its inland path, primarily in Florida, where winds and the resulting floodwaters were highest. Its storm surge was record-breaking from the Big Bend region south to Tampa Bay. The system also spawned a tornado outbreak with around 12 confirmed tornadoes. Idalia was the most powerful hurricane to hit Florida's Big Bend region since the 1896 Cedar Keys hurricane. Four people died in storm-related incidents in the two states. Early estimates placed insured losses at $2.2–5 billion. The hurricane's remnants produced dangerous rip currents across the Eastern United States during Labor Day Weekend, resulting in several additional deaths and numerous rescues."
134,Hurricane Idalia,Meteorological history,,"On August 24, 2023, a trough of low pressure formed in the Eastern Pacific basin offshore of the Central America coast. The disturbance crossed over into the Atlantic basin the following day, and began to organize as it moved northward through the western Caribbean Sea. The pace of organization quickened on August 26, while the disturbance was located near the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula, and at 21:00 UTC it was upgraded to Tropical Depression Ten. Later that day, and into the next, the depression drifted due to weak surrounding steering currents, with its center moving in a small counterclockwise loop. The depression became Tropical Storm Idalia at 15:15 UTC on August 27, after a NOAA Hurricane Hunters flight reported that the storm's winds had increased to 40 mph (65 km/h). Early the next morning, Idalia began moving northward toward the Yucatán Channel west of Cuba, intensifying along the way despite being impacted by moderate northwesterly wind shear.
By 09:00 UTC on August 29, after passing near the western tip of Cuba, Idalia had developed an inner core and almost complete eyewall and the NHC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane. Later that day, Idalia began to rapidly intensify, reaching Category 2 strength as it benefited from exceptional conditions, with sea-surface temperatures of 88 °F (31 °C), generally low wind shear, and high relative humidity levels. Idalia continued to rapidly intensify as it accelerated northward off the Florida Suncoast and approached the Big Bend region, reaching its peak intensity of Category 4 strength on the morning of August 30, a few hours prior to landfall, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 940 mbar (27.76 inHg). This marked a wind increase of 55 mph (89 km/h) during the 24 hour period ending at 09:00 UTC on August 30, making it one of fastest rates of tropical cyclone intensification ever observed in the Atlantic basin 24 hours before landfall. At its peak, the NHC described the system as having ""a small eye surrounded by very cold clouds tops, especially in the western quadrant."" Idalia's intensification was then halted by an eyewall replacement cycle, which caused it to weaken slightly prior to landfall. Idalia made landfall at 11:45 UTC, about 20 miles (30 km) south of Perry, Florida, as a Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 949 mbar (28.02 inHg).The system quickly weakened inland as it pushed through North Florida, becoming a tropical storm later that day after crossing into Georgia. Strong southwesterly wind shear then pushed the storm's convection well north and east of its center as it moved off the northeastern South Carolina coast and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on the morning of August 31. That afternoon, Idalia transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone about 65 miles (105 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. As the storm moved to the east-southeast the following day, light wind shear along its path enabled the system to maintain its structure and intensity despite the lack of convection. The storm impacted Bermuda with tropical-storm-force winds on September 2, as it passed just to the south. Idalia's remnant low then absorbed Tropical Storm Gert on September 4 and lingered off the coast of Atlantic Canada for several days, before dissipating on September 8."
135,Hurricane Idalia,Preparations,Cuba,"More than 10,000 people were evacuated from Pinar del Río and Artemisa provinces. Patients in Bahía Honda were evacuated to a local clinic after fearing flooding."
136,Hurricane Idalia,Preparations,United States,"On August 28, hurricane warnings and storm surge warnings were issued for portions of the Florida's west coast. On August 29, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Day 1 convective outlook highlighting a level 2/slight risk of severe weather for portions of Florida associated with Idalia, with the SPC also issuing a 5 percent tornado risk. A Day 2 convective outlook was also issued concerning a level 2/slight risk and a 5 percent tornado risk for portions of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. A moderate risk of excessive rainfall was also issued by the Weather Prediction Center, for the most of the same areas included in the Day 2 Convective outlook. A tornado watch was issued for portions of western Florida on August 29, as bands of thunderstorms from Idalia moved inland.Amtrak terminated its two southbound Silver Service routes in Jacksonville, Florida on August 28 and cancelled both routes and its Auto Train service from August 29 to 30. The Palmetto route was truncated to Washington D.C. as well. At least 900 flights were cancelled across Florida and Georgia."
137,Hurricane Idalia,Preparations,Bermuda,A tropical storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August 30; this was later changed to a warning as the storm moved closer. This occurred just days after Hurricane Franklin produced tropical storm force winds to the island.
138,Hurricane Idalia,Impact,Caribbean,"The storm brought heavy rainfall to the Yucatán Peninsula. As Idalia became a tropical storm, Cayman Islands were lashed with rough seas and strong winds. Owen Roberts International Airport had recorded a peak wind gust of 35 mph (56 km/h). Idalia also brought heavy rain, reaching up to 2 inches (51 mm) causing some flooding. Flooding occurred in Güira de Melena and Guanimar in Cuba, and high winds hit Pinar del Río Province. Rainfall reached 4 inches (100 mm) across portions of the country."
139,Hurricane Idalia,Impact,United States,"As of September 25, assessed damage reached $704.1 million across Florida and Georgia. In Florida, at least 21,252 insurance claims were made with losses totaling $216.1 million. Agricultural losses reached $447 million in the state. Damage in Georgia exceeded $41 million. Estimates of total damage across the Southeastern United States vary widely from various insurance companies and catastrophe modelers. Early calculations showed possibilities of damage exceeding $9 billion and potentially reaching $20 billion, though these tempered as time passed. On September 4, Moody's Analytics reported private insured losses at $3–5 billion with a ""best estimate"" of $3.5 billion. They indicated losses attached to the National Flood Insurance Program would reach $500 million. Verisk Analytics placed the same metric at $2.5–4 billion. Karen Clark & Co. estimated losses at $2.2 billion on September 1. Of this, $2 billion was from wind-related damage and $210 million from storm surge. Regularly improving building codes across Florida are attributed with lesser damage as structures are more able to withstand the effects of hurricanes. Homes built on stilts and with properly secured roofs suffered minimal damage while older structures were severely affected.At least ten people were killed in incidents related to the hurricane: four in Florida, three in New Jersey, and one each in Delaware, Georgia, and North Carolina."
140,Hurricane Idalia,Impact,Bermuda,"On September 2, the Department of Marine and Ports Services announced that ferries were suspended until weather conditions improved, BELCO announced that Idalia had caused over 6,000 power outages, and the Department of Public Transportation announced the temporary suspension of bus services. Idalia also caused all flights to and from L.F. Wade International Airport and North America to be cancelled or delayed on September 2, with some flights also being affected the following day."
141,Hurricane Idalia,Aftermath,United States,"On August 31, 2023, President Joe Biden said that he had spoken to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and other governors about Idalia and that he had approved of their requests for disaster and emergency declarations."

146,List of alleged Georgia election racketeers,Pled guilty,,"4 of the 19 individuals who were indicted have pled guilty as of October 24, 2023.

Kenneth Chesebro, pro-Trump lawyer who acted as an outside adviser, seven felony charges. He pled guilty on October 20, 2023. The original charges related to writing memos and emails describing how Georgia and other states could ""convene and cast false Electoral College votes"". Politically liberal until around 2016, after earning his law degree he worked on prominent cases such as the Iran–Contra investigation as a deputy special counsel, and Bush v. Gore as research assistant for his former Harvard law professor, Laurence Tribe. However, Chesebro's political views had flipped by 2016 when he assisted Eastman with litigation against birthright citizenship, upon which Trump had been campaigning since 2015. He wrote three memos in 2020—dated November 18, December 6, and December 9—originating the idea of creating ""alternate slates of electors"" in states Biden had won.Sidney Powell, Trump campaign lawyer, seven felony charges. On October 19, 2023, Powell pled guilty to six misdemeanor counts in the case. She had been accused of: making false statements that the election results were fraudulent; contracting SullivanStrickler to collect and analyze data from Dominion Voting Systems equipment in multiple states, ultimately leading to the ""unlawful breach of election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia"".Jenna Ellis, Trump campaign lawyer, two felonies. Accused of soliciting Georgia state senators to violate their oaths of office ""by unlawfully appointing presidential electors from the State of Georgia."" She pled guilty on October 24, 2023.Scott Graham Hall, bail bondsman, seven felonies. Allegations included: ""looking into the election on behalf of [Trump]"". He has been described in the press as being ""at the center of the breach of election equipment in Coffee County"". He was the first to plead guilty on September 29.

150,List of United States tornadoes from July to August 2023,Summary,,"This page documents all tornadoes confirmed by various weather forecast offices of the National Weather Service in the United States in July and August 2023. Tornado counts are considered preliminary until final publication in the database of the National Centers for Environmental Information. On average, there are 119 confirmed tornadoes in the United States in July and 81 in August.The northern states nearer the Canadian border are most favored for tornadoes in July and August, including the Upper Midwest, the Great Lakes and the Northeastern states, due to the positioning of the summertime jet stream. Summer thunderstorms and tropical activity can also result in increased (mostly weak) tornado activity in the Florida Peninsula. In addition, there can also be occasional increases in the southern and eastern United States as a result of tornadoes from landfalling tropical cyclones should such occur, especially in August.With 111 confirmed tornadoes, July saw near average levels of tornadic activity. No major outbreaks occurred during the month, although widespread severe weather with limited to scattered tornado activity occurred on most days. August saw somewhat above average activity with 120 confirmed tornadoes and more significant tornadoes were confirmed during that time then in July especially in the climatologically favored Great Lakes and Northeast. However, no large outbreaks occurred during this month as well. Tropical tornadoes did not occur until the end of the month, when Hurricane Idalia moved through the Southeastern United States."

198,Montgomery Riverfront brawl,Summary,,"On August 5, 2023, a large-scale altercation took place at the riverfront dock in downtown Montgomery, Alabama. The incident gained significant media attention due to its violent nature, the racial undertones, and Montgomery's racially charged history."
199,Montgomery Riverfront brawl,Background and incident,,"On August 5, 2023 around 7:00 p.m., the riverboat Harriott II, carrying 227 passengers, returned to the Riverfront Park dock on the Alabama River in Montgomery, Alabama. In an interview with CNN, the captain, a white man, of the Harriott II, stated the vessel had just completed the ""5 to 7"" cruise. The captain explained that a moored pontoon boat prevented the exit ramp of the Harriott II from aligning with the dock. There were no signs or markings indicating to the pontoon boat owner that the space was reserved for the Harriott II.The riverboat's captain attempted to get the pontoon's operators to move their boat, but they did not. Passengers on the Harriott II shouted at them to move the boat. After failing to get the pontoon boat owners to move for 45 minutes, the African American co-captain of the Harriott II and an unidentified 16-year-old white male deckhand were transported to the dock to move the pontoon boat. The co-captain provided a written statement to police, stating that he untied the pontoon boat from the dock ""moving it 3 steps to the right"", with the assistance of the deckhand. They were then confronted by the boat owners.Video of the incident shows individuals arguing with the co-captain. A short time later, he was assaulted by a white man, who shouted at him not to touch the boat. The two then began to fight, and another white man and white woman from the private boat also attacked the co-captain. Video shows that multiple individuals, white and black, attempted to break up the initial assault. A white dock worker was also assaulted. The initial assault was broken up in less than a minute. 
Arguments and fights with Harriott II workers continued. A black teenager was filmed swimming across the river to the dock. He arrived at the dock after the initial assault was defused. Moments later, he fought with two white men and pushed a white woman.When the Harriott II docked, crew members disembarked and confronted the initial assailants, which led to another altercation. The co-captain's sister was involved with this new fight and the co-captain ""grabbed her and moved her"". At the Harriott II, bystanders and individuals connected to the initial assault begin arguing and punching each other. A black man used a folding chair to hit a white man and a white woman who had been punched and knocked down by multiple black women. Some white people were thrown into the river. Police were contacted at 7:00 p.m. and again at 7:15 p.m., arriving at the scene around 7:18 p.m.The predominant racial lines of the fighting led to allegations that the assailants were racially motivated in their attack. 
The altercations were caught on video."
200,Montgomery Riverfront brawl,Aftermath and investigation,,"The immediate aftermath of the brawl saw 13 individuals detained and questioned, including the co-captain who was hit by a police taser, but subsequently released. Montgomery Police Chief Darryl J. Albert confirmed arrest warrants for three men involved in the incident.Arrest warrants were then expanded to another woman and a man hitting people with a chair. All five surrendered at the police station the following week.The investigation was intensified due to the racial implications surrounding the fight. While the altercation mainly occurred along racial lines, preliminary investigations did not find sufficient evidence for hate crime charges. However, the incident has revived discussions around Montgomery's racial history, especially given the city's pivotal role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the Montgomery bus boycott during the Civil Rights movement."
201,Montgomery Riverfront brawl,Public reaction and media coverage,,"The video of the brawl quickly went viral, drawing national attention and sparking discussions on race relations in Montgomery.
Mayor Steven Reed condemned the brawl, describing the instigators as ""reckless individuals"" and commending the swift response of the police department and community members.Writing for the Montgomery Advertiser, journalist Shannon Heupel detailed positive reactions to the co-captain. A 16-year old Black male wearing a blue ""crew"" shirt, identified publicly as ""Aaren,"" was nicknamed ""Black Aquaman"" after he dived off Harriott II to defend the co-captain. His actions were also praised.The brawl was recounted in the song ""Montgomery Brawl"".

202,Mug shot of Donald Trump,Summary,,"On August 24, 2023, after being indicted on racketeering and related charges, Donald Trump, the former president of the United States, voluntarily surrendered himself to authorities at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia, where a mug shot of him was taken.
In the photo, Trump, wearing a blue suit with a white shirt and red tie, glowers at the camera in front of a gray backdrop, his face lit from the side and above. It is the first and only police booking photograph of a U.S. president.After its publishing, the mug shot was used in Internet memes, used on merchandise by Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, and featured on multiple newspaper front pages worldwide."
203,Mug shot of Donald Trump,Background,,"On August 14, 2023, a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia indicted Trump on charges of election racketeering and related offenses, and issued an arrest warrant. The county's district attorney offered him the option to surrender voluntarily. Shortly after 19:30 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), August 24, Trump turned himself in at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia and was booked, given inmate number P01135809, processed and released on bond.At 20:05 EDT, a copy of the booking photograph without the Fulton County Jail watermark was posted on Twitter. CNN released the official image at 21:27.At 21:38, Trump posted the photograph to Twitter with the text ""mug shot - August 24, 2023, election interference, never surrender"" in all capitals. The post contained a link to a WinRed page soliciting contributions for his 2024 presidential campaign. The post was Trump's first activity on the platform since his account was reinstated in November 2022 by Twitter's new owner Elon Musk."
204,Mug shot of Donald Trump,Usage,Fundraising,"Prior to Trump's arraignment in April 2023 in New York City, his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, said that any mug shot of Trump would ""go down in history as the most famous mug shot ever to exist in America"". Additionally, Trump spokesman Hogan Gidley stated that such a photograph would be the ""most manly, most masculine, most handsome mug shot of all time"". No booking photograph was taken during the arraignment, and Trump's campaign website began selling T-shirts featuring a pretend mug shot.Ninety minutes after Trump's release from Fulton County Jail on August 24, the Trump campaign began selling T-shirts, mugs, and other merchandise with his booking photograph. On August 26, the campaign said it had raised $7.1 million since the release of the photo. The Lincoln Project, sellers on Etsy, and others also began selling merchandise with the booking photo, and, despite not having the copyright, the Trump campaign threatened to sue anyone who did not obtain their prior authorization."
205,Mug shot of Donald Trump,Usage,News coverage,"Many newspapers in the United States and other countries featured the mug shot ""splashed across"" or in articles on the front page of their print issues while others printed teasers with thumbnails of the booking photograph on the front page. Other news outlets reported on the reporting.Fox News featured the mug shot in an article on an exclusive interview Trump gave them soon after his release from jail. They cited him as saying that ""officials in Georgia 'insisted' on a mugshot"" and that he ""agreed to do that""."
206,Mug shot of Donald Trump,Reactions,,"The Associated Press called it ""an American moment"" and an ""enduring image that will appear in history books long after Donald Trump is gone."" They described the image as Trump glaring at the camera defiantly, as if he was ""staring down a nemesis through the lens."" The Guardian's Chris McGreal referred to it as the defining mug shot of the decade, and one that defines modern U.S. politics. He noted, ""Trump's hostility shines through as he turns his eyes up toward the camera above him and in his taut, downturned mouth ... Dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie, he makes no attempt to put on a smile like some of his co-defendants in their mugshots. The picture does not flatter but it does convey the message many of Trump's supporters want to hear – belligerence.""The New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman called the image ""a mug shot for history that is unprecedented"" and noted that ""his face is lit from above by a blinding white flash that hits his ash blond hair like a spotlight. ... He glowers out from beneath his brows, unsmiling, eyes rendered oddly bloodshot, brow furrowed, chin tucked in, as if he is about to head-butt the camera. The image is stark, shorn of the flags and fancy that have been Mr. Trump's preferred framings for photo ops at Mar-a-Lago or Trump Tower, or during his term in office, and that communicate power and the gilded glow of success."" Friedman quoted historian Sean Wilentz as saying that, of the myriad of photos of Trump, it could be the most famous or notorious and serve as ""the ultimate bookend to a political arc in the United States that began decades ago, with Richard Nixon's 'I am not a crook.'""CNN called the image ""one of the most iconic images of anyone who served as commander in chief"" and ""stark in its simplicity in a way that must surely grate for an ex-reality star for whom image is everything"". The Independent observed that ""the 45th president glowers straight into the camera, brow furrowed and sizable bushy eyebrows lowered as he faces his fate"", adding ""it is an undeniable fact that Trump's mug shot is both historically and culturally significant – and soon to be seen everywhere, forever.""The Telegraph stated, ""The 45th president is pictured striking a hostile pose, with his eyebrows contracted, lips pursed and a menacing scowl on his face. His head and the top of his shoulders are visible in what is likely to become a world-famous image."" Time commented, ""His platinum blonde [sic] cotton candy wisp of hair shimmering in the harsh jailhouse lighting. His eyes locked in a hard stare. His mouth flattened in a grimace. Instead of smiling like some of his co-defendants, he appears to be scowling."" BBC News referred to the composition of the picture as a ""photographer's nightmare.""Commentators have likened Trump's expression to the ""Kubrick stare"", emblematic of several memorable characters of American filmmaker Stanley Kubrick's films. In Internet memes and commentary, the booking photograph was also said to imitate character Vigo the Cruel's ""menacing stare featured prominently in Ghostbusters II"", as well as the eponymous character's ""blue steel"" pose in the movie Zoolander.Columnist Maureen Dowd of The New York Times observed that ""the Picture of Donald Trump should have been a 'foul parody,' a reflection of what the chancer has done with his life. It should have shown Trump's corroding soul rather than his truculent face. It should have revealed a man so cynical and depraved that he is willing to smash our nation’s soul – our democracy – and destroy faith in our institutions. All this simply to avoid being called a loser."" On August 27, art critic Jerry Saltz called the mug shot ""the most famous photograph in the world"" and that ""[a]lready the man with the scowl is using his portrait as both a statement of defiance and a claim of persecution — a symbol as diabolically ingenious as the red MAGA hat.""When asked by a journalist for his opinion of the photograph, Joe Biden, Trump's presidential successor, quipped that Trump is a ""handsome guy, wonderful guy""."

227,Hurricane Hilary,Summary,,"Hurricane Hilary was a large, potent Category 4 Pacific hurricane in August 2023 which brought torrential rainfall and gusty winds to the Pacific Coast of Mexico, the Baja California Peninsula and the Southwestern United States, resulting in widespread flooding and numerous mudslides. Hilary broke records in four U.S. states for wettest tropical cyclone or its remnants.
The eighth named storm, sixth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season, Hilary originated from a disturbance south of Mexico associated with a tropical wave that entered the Pacific Ocean from Central America on August 12. The disturbance gradually grew more organized, and was named Tropical Storm Hilary while off the coast of Manzanillo, Colima, on August 16. Hilary quickly strengthened into a hurricane the next day. While tracking west-northwestward on August 17 and 18, it underwent rapid intensification, reaching its peak as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) and a central pressure of 939 mbar (27.7 inHg). The cyclone then quickly weakened the following day due to the effects of cooler sea surface temperatures, drier air, and increasing wind shear. After weakening into a tropical storm, Hilary made landfall in San Quintín, Baja California, at 18:00 UTC on August 20, about 215 mi (345 km) south-southeast of San Diego, California. It then tracked northward into California, retaining its tropical characteristics through the morning of August 21. It then transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone while over the southern San Joaquin Valley. Hilary was the first tropical storm to enter California since Nora in 1997.In anticipation of ""catastrophic and life-threatening flooding"", the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued its first-ever tropical storm warning for Southern California, extending from the Mexico–United States border to just north of Los Angeles. Persistent heavy rainfall, potentially ""more than a year’s worth of rain"" in some areas, was forecasted. Due to this, flood watches were issued, affecting about 26 million people across four states (Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah), and the entire region was placed under a high risk threat for flash flooding by the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).Two fatalities, both in Mexico, have been linked to Hilary. Additionally, the storm left behind flooded roads, mudslides and downed trees in the Baja California peninsula and in Southern California. Even so, its overall impact on the region was less severe than initially feared."
228,Hurricane Hilary,Meteorological history,,"On August 12, a tropical wave traversing Central America producing widespread rain showers and thunderstorms entered the far eastern Pacific. A broad area of low pressure developed within the wave on August 14, off the southern coasts of Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador. The disturbance gradually became better organized during the following day, and a well-defined circulation along with developing convective banding features were observed on the morning of August 16, thus prompting the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify it as Tropical Storm Hilary. Convection near the storm's center increased throughout the day, dense overcast started to develop over the growing storm as a result, and an eye began to form at its center. Consequently, Hilary quickly strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on August 17, while located about 320 mi (515 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. Deep convection intensified beneath the system's cloud tops, which had cooled to below −112 °F (−80 °C), and its expanding upper-level outflow pattern became symmetric. Hilary continued to rapidly intensify, reaching Category 4 strength at 06:00 UTC on August 18.
By 15:00 UTC that day, Hilary's intensity leveled off with peak sustained winds at 145 mph (230 km/h), an increase of 80 mph (130 km/h) over a 24‑hour period. Hilary benefited from exceptional conditions during its intensification phase, with sea-surface temperatures of near 86 °F (30 °C), low wind shear, and high relative humidity levels. A hurricane hunter flight later that day confirmed that Hilary was a Category 4 hurricane, though not as strong as expected, with maximum sustained winds determined to be at 130 mph (215 km/h). The hurricane initially tracked west-northwestward, then toward the northwest during this time, responding to the steering influences of a trough of low pressure to its north near the California coast and a ridge of high pressure over the central United States. As those influences began drawing Hilary north-northwestward on the morning of August 19, asymmetrical convective patterns developed as the deep convection on the west side of the system was being eroded by an intrusion of dry and stable air. This caused the hurricane to weaken to Category 3 strength, with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). By the end of that day, the hurricane had dropped to Category 1 as a result of the adverse effects of cooler waters, drier air, and increasing shear. At around 10:30 UTC the eye of the storm briefly touched the mainland at Punta Eugenia, Baja California Sur, before passing over the nearby inhabited islands of Natividad and Cedros.Hilary made landfall at around 18:00 UTC on August 20, with sustained winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) in San Quintín, Baja California, or about 215 mi (345 km) south-southeast of San Diego, California. The storm continued to move north-northwestward after landfall, and crossed into California about six hours later, south-southwest of Palm Springs. Late that day, the storm's low-level center became increasingly diffused and more difficult to track, eventually briefly reconsolidating along the coast of south-central Los Angeles. On the morning of August 21, while moving over the southern San Joaquin Valley, Hilary became a post-tropical cyclone. Its upper level remnants then tracked north into the Rocky Mountains due to a jet stream."
229,Hurricane Hilary,Preparations,Mexico,"The Mexican government issued watches for southern Baja California Sur on August 17. They were upgraded to warnings later that day. Hurricane watches were issued for western parts of the Baja California peninsula at 03:00 UTC on August 18, and by 15:00 UTC the same day, they were upgraded to hurricane warnings as hurricane watches were issued for the west coast of Baja California.Ports were closed to navigation along the Pacific coast from Oaxaca to Colima on August 17.

The strongest winds beyond California primarily occurred in Nevada and Utah at high-elevation locations above 9,000 ft (2,700 m), with the weather station at Cardiff Pass (Utah) recording a gust of 75 mph (121 km/h). Records for wettest (total rainfall) tropical cyclones and their remnants were broken in four states: Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon. The new mark in Nevada is more than double the previous record. The resulting flash flooding there forced the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area to close indefinitely.Arizona received much less precipitation from Hilary than forecasted. In contrast to Nevada, where several locations received over 2 in (51 mm) of precipitation, only one did so in Arizona – Hilltop recorded (2.10 in (53 mm); most places received less than 1 in (25 mm)."
233,Hurricane Hilary,Impact,In popular culture,"Hilary's push toward Southern California coincided with a 5.1 magnitude earthquake that struck north of Los Angeles near Ojai, California, along with numerous aftershocks. Only minor damage and no injuries were reported from the quakes. As a result, the term ""hurriquake"" trended on social media."

242,2024 Republican Party presidential debates and forums,Controversies,Purpose of debates without Trump,"The core purpose of the Republican debates has been questioned as they are being conducted without the presence of Donald Trump who held a clear lead before and during the debates. Some anonymous RNC officials have described the debates as ""embarrassing"" for not having Trump."
243,2024 Republican Party presidential debates and forums,Controversies,First debate qualification controversy,"The first scheduled debate participants were listed in a RNC press release on August 21, 2023. Eight candidates qualified according to RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel although three other candidates also claimed they had qualified (Elder, Johnson and Suarez).No initial explanation was given as to why Johnson, who had qualified according to Politico’s analysis, or Suarez, who claimed he qualified, had been excluded, though it was later indicated that one of the polls from Victory Insights, which Johnson had used to count towards his total, was discarded as it ""only surveyed voters in 38 states"". A poll from Rasmussen Reports, which Elder's campaign had believed would help him qualify, was discounted as the RNC claimed that the company was affiliated with Trump. Similarly, Suarez' campaign was hopeful that a poll would count in their favor was discounted as the pollster was affiliated with Ramaswamy. Elder and Johnson announced on August 22 that they would sue the RNC as a result of being excluded. Hurd, who also failed to make the debate stage, strongly criticized the RNC.After the RNC press release was publicized, Suarez acknowledged that he did not qualify for the debate. Johnson and Elder disputed the RNC debate participant list and contended that they had qualified.
Politico launched its own tracker for debate qualification in March. The methodology and requirements for polling were considered to be unclear by many and created areas of discrepancy. Politico argued that campaigns and pollsters found the polling requirements to be vague and could be used to eliminate seemingly qualified candidates; the RNC did not respond to questions from Politico regarding the polling requirements. According to their tracker and analysis of the polling data, Johnson qualified for the first debate; he issued a press release detailing the timeline/sequence of events and correspondence with the RNC and his campaign.Johnson began his attacks against the RNC leadership and the debate rules. Elder has also been critical of the fundraising criteria and the fundraising tactics of the Johnson, Ramaswamy, and Burgum campaigns and suggested that the debate rules were rigged for DeSantis.Johnson stated on August 21 that he will still go to Milwaukee to attend the debate. Elder stated the following day that he plans to attend the debate nonetheless. Ultimately, neither Elder or Johnson were invited or attended the debate. Elder stated that ""Not only was I barred from the debate, I was barred from the debate venue. They posted a notice and told security if Elder or Elder's campaign showed up, don't let them in. So what am I now, a terrorist?"" NBC correspondent Dasha Burns posted a picture on social media that was on the security desk that detailed who was not allowed at the debate venue. This included Elder and his campaign, three Trump staffers (Jason Miller, Justin Caparole and Danny Tiso) and Vivek Ramaswamy campaign credentials. Fox News clarified that it was not involved with the ""production of the document"" and ""did not sanction"" the wording.McDaniel defended the criteria, stating that ""they were applied ... equally to every candidate"", as did Keith Schipper, an RNC spokesman."
244,2024 Republican Party presidential debates and forums,Controversies,New Hampshire scheduling controversy,"The RNC has warned the New Hampshire state party that if it proceeds with moving the 2024 New Hampshire Republican presidential primary ahead of the 2024 Iowa Republican presidential caucuses, a presidential debate will not be held there."
245,2024 Republican Party presidential debates and forums,Controversies,Tim Scott third debate qualification controversy,"Up until the final deadline for qualifying, neither the New York Times nor Politico confirmed a qualifying national poll where Senator Tim Scott had attained four percent support. However, Scott's campaign insisted that a ""little-noticed"" poll conducted in September by YouGov for progressive outlet The Liberal Patriot had him at four percent support. FiveThirtyEight believed that the poll would not qualify as the screening question used for determining likely primary voters ""resulted in the survey including a large number of Democrats in the sample"". However, the RNC ultimately decided to count the poll."
246,2024 Republican Party presidential debates and forums,Controversies,Family Leader Foundation forum controversy,"The RNC, on November 11, initially threatened to disqualify candidates from participating in future debates if they participated in the Thanksgiving Family Forum that is scheduled to be hosted by the Family Leader Foundation on November 17, which the RNC initially considered to be a debate. The president of the foundation, Bob Vander Plaats, indicated the same day that the RNC would allow the forum to go forward, with no repercussions for candidates who attend. DeSantis, Scott and Ramaswamy have indicated that they plan to attend it."

249,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Summary,,"From July 14 to November 9, 2023, the American actors' union SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) was on strike over a labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).  As the longest strike in SAG-AFTRA history, its combined impact with the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike resulted in the loss of 45,000 jobs, and ""an estimated $6.5 billion"" loss to the economy of Southern California. According to Deadline Hollywood, the ""harshest pain"" was ""perhaps felt among the below-the-line workers who've had to sell or mortgage their homes, and wipe through IRAs to survive.""Along with the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike (which ended on September 27, 2023), it was part of a series of broader Hollywood labor disputes. Both the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes contributed to the biggest interruption to the American film and television industries since the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 just three years prior. In addition to standing in solidarity with the writers, the strike was led by changes in the industry caused by streaming and its effect on residuals, as well as other new technologies like AI and digital recreation. It marked the first time that actors initiated a labor dispute in the U.S. since the 1980 actors strike and the first time that actors and writers have walked out simultaneously since 1960.
Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP took place from October 2 to October 11, and resumed on October 24. On November 8, 2023, a tentative deal between the two sides was reached. Striking ended on November 9 at 12:01 a.m. PST."
250,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Background,Unionization in Hollywood,"The Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) is a labor union that represents approximately 160,000 media professionals and entertainers. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) trade association represents film and television studios in collective bargaining negotiations with unions such as SAG-AFTRA, the Directors Guild of America (DGA), and Writers Guild of America, East and Writers Guild of America West, comprising the Writers Guild of America (WGA). SAG-AFTRA was formed by the merger of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) in March 2012, allowing SAG-AFTRA to represent not only actors, but also journalists, talk show hosts, and other broadcast workers. The WGA and the Screen Actors Guild have not simultaneously been on strike since 1960, when actors joined striking writers over residual payments from films sold to television networks. The 1980 actors strike involved the combined efforts of SAG and AFTRA. The largest SAG-AFTRA strike since 1980 occurred in 2000, in which commercial actors went on strike to push for a continuation of the residual system against advertiser backlash, amidst the divisions between SAG and AFTRA.During the last decade and the rise of streaming, writers and actors have been frustrated over studio policy regarding residuals from streaming services; the decline of network television has led to a stronger reliance on other residuals. The 2007–08 WGA strike was motivated in large part by studio executives insisting that writers should receive no residuals from streaming services. The 2007–08 strike cost the city of Los Angeles an estimated US$1.5 billion, according to NPR. As with striking WGA writers, actors have expressed concerns about the use of artificial intelligence, noting that it could be used to replicate their likeness without compensation."
251,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Background,Pre-strike activity,"Weeks after the Writers Guild of America went on strike in May 2023, SAG-AFTRA's national board of directors unanimously agreed to pursue a strike authorization vote ahead of a renewed contract; SAG-AFTRA approved a new contract in 2020 that would expire on June 30, 2023. The union stated that it did not intend to strike but that it sought to give its negotiators ""maximum bargaining leverage"" ahead of negotiations on June 7, 2023. SAG-AFTRA cited several issues in negotiations, including ""economic fairness, residuals, regulating the use of artificial intelligence and alleviating the burdens of the industry-wide shift to self-taping"", and told its members that the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers would cut actors' salaries to ""pad corporate profits"". In a video released on May 30, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jean Smart, and Kumail Nanjiani appealed to members to vote to strike but reserved that a vote for strike authorization was solely a bargaining tool, not a vote to order an immediate strike.On June 5, 2023, SAG-AFTRA approved the strike authorization by a 98% margin, according to the union. High-profile members—including Quinta Brunson, Jennifer Lawrence, and Rami Malek—signaled their willingness to strike ahead of the deadline to achieve a ""transformative deal"", despite ""extremely productive"" negotiations. SAG-AFTRA agreed to extend negotiations to midnight on July 13, 2023, in an attempt to avoid a strike, but negotiations broke down in July 2023. SAG-AFTRA surveyed members on a strike on July 5, 2023 and began preparing picket signs two days later.The AMPTP agreed to a ""last-minute request"" for mediation from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service on July 11, 2023; congressional and public affairs director Greg Raelson stated that a federal mediator would be present the following day. In turn, SAG-AFTRA accused the AMPTP of attempting to extend negotiations beyond the deadline and reiterated that it would not continue negotiating after July 12, 2023. A number of high-profile actors, including Lawrence and Malek, then affirmed their support again by signing a letter urging the union to take aggressive measures and stating their willingness to strike. It was later reported by Variety that mediation collapsed after AMPTP President Carol Lombardini insulted negotiators by telling them to ""be civilized"" and avert a strike, which prompted a walkout by union negotiators. In response to Lombardini's comment, SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher reportedly said to AMPTP negotiators ""Now you've got two unions on strike"" as they left.On July 12, a statement was made announcing the construction of a Fast & Furious-themed roller coaster; the date of the announcement coincided with the deadline SAG-AFTRA gave before ending negotiations with the AMPTP, and construction began by the strike's start. This added to the construction that began on May 8, shortly after the WGA began protesting on-site, obstructing Lankershim Boulevard along the west end of the park's campus and parking lot and further restricting sidewalk access. The sidewalks in front of Gates 1, 2, 4, and 5 would be scaffolded-off and demolished in this construction. Despite prior advice from the Los Angeles Police Department's Labor Relations Unit to place K-rails from River Road to Universal Hollywood Drive for the safety of protesters and other pedestrians since WGA protests as early as June 6, none were placed by July 18, by which time reports of two protesters being struck by vehicles had been made.
On July 13, with no agreement between SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee voted unanimously to recommend a strike to the union's national board. The national board held a vote officially approving the strike. SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher announced the strike would begin at midnight on July 14; the cast of Oppenheimer left the film's London premiere ahead of the announcement to walk out. Joined by chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Drescher asserted that the strike was a reluctant last resort and described the proposed contract as ""moving around furniture on the Titanic."" In the press conference, Crabtree-Ireland alleged that the AMPTP attempted to include a proposal that allowed studios to, for a one-time fee equivalent to one day's pay, have exclusive and indefinite rights to extras' likenesses, including the use of generative AI to replicate them on screen. Media commentators likened this to the film The Congress (2013) and the Black Mirror sixth series episode ""Joan Is Awful"" (2023). However, AMPTP denied these claims, stating that their proposal would allow usage of these replicas within the specific film for which they are employed, and that any other uses would require consent and further compensation."
252,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Jul-23,"The strike officially began on July 14. As part of the rules established on July 10, actors cannot engage in film or television productions and cannot take part in promotional work, such as press junkets, film premieres, and events—including San Diego Comic-Con, which was scheduled for July 20–23. The strike action does not apply to SAG-AFTRA members who work under contracts that are negotiated by the union separately from the AMPTP contract, including broadcast journalists. Work in podcasts, ""micro-budget"" independent films, and student films is allowed, as is ""unscripted"" television work such as game shows, reality competition shows, documentaries, and talk shows. Internationally, SAG-AFTRA members are authorized to continue work in the United Kingdom under pre-established Equity collective bargaining agreements, as UK law criminalizes solidarity strikes. The HBO series House of the Dragon thus continued its UK-based filming with SAG-AFTRA actors operating under Equity contracts, prompting backlash among fans of the series.On July 17, the Ficus trees on Barham Boulevard's sidewalk outside Gate 8 were pruned almost entirely of their leaves. Pine trees on the opposite side of Barham were not touched, nor were a row of pepper trees behind the fence near the production gate. The pruning was described as a vindictive action because the trees had been being used by protesters as shade from the over 90 °F (32 °C) summer temperatures of Southern California. The pruning was also described as illegal, on the grounds that the trees are owned by the city and that Los Angeles' tree ordinances prohibit trimming them between July and September. NBCUniversal issued a statement to Deadline Hollywood denying that the trimming was done out of malice, claiming that they trim the trees outside the park in July annually for safety, and describing it and the obstructive construction hazards as ""unintended challenges for demonstrators"". NBCUniversal was fined US$250 for violating tree laws and destroying city property.Also on July 17, SAG-AFTRA released a twelve-page statement outlining the breakdown in negotiations, and terms they found unacceptable, including but not limited to a five-percent salary increase for actors, while the union had asked for eleven percent. The AMPTP released a counter-statement, highlighting that its actions were being ""deliberately distort[ed]"" and that SAG-AFTRA had chosen to pass over ""the most lucrative deal we have ever negotiated... valued at $318 million over the three-year term of the contract.""On July 18, NBCUniversal was accused of conducting business at Universal Studios Hollywood to deter or endanger the protesters and infringe on their rights to protest. In response, SAG-AFTRA and WGA issued a joint grievance to the National Labor Relations Board against NBCUniversal, accusing the company of interfering with their freedom to picket and endangering their members. Writers Guild of America West additionally filed a petition to the AMPTP in response to NBCUniversal's failure to install barriers to protect WGA and SAG-AFTRA protestors from the risk of being forced into traffic. NBCUniversal responded to The Hollywood Reporter in a statement: ""We are aware of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA complaints. We strongly believe that the company has fulfilled our legal obligations under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and we will cooperate with respect to any inquiries by the National Labor Relations Board on this issue. While we understand the timing of our multi-year construction project has created challenges for demonstrators, we continue to work with public agencies to increase access. We support the unions' rights to demonstrate safely.""On July 19, 2023, SAG-AFTRA approved more films to be shot during the strike, including Ishana Night Shyamalan's The Watchers, Sam Raimi's Don't Move, and David Lowery's Mother Mary. 56 films then became eligible to shoot under strike rules.On July 25, 2023, thousands of actors rallied Tuesday morning at Times Square from 9:30 A.M. to noon to voice their concerns about fair treatment and wages. SAG-AFTRA's main contractual negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland spoke about the struggle that the union is facing with the AMPTP.  Many celebrities gave speeches to express their concerns about the future of their union and technological advancements in the industry.  In attendance were: Lauren Ambrose, Matt Bomer, Christine Baranski, Steve Buscemi, Bobby Cannavale, Tituss Burgess, Liza Colón-Zayas, Bryan Cranston, Jessica Chastain, Gregory Diaz, Jennifer Ehle, Brendan Fraser, Nancy Giles, Danai Gurira, Jill Hennessy, Marin Hinkle, Stephen Lang, Arian Moayed, Christopher Meloni, Chloë Grace Moretz, Wendell Pierce, Michael Shannon, Christian Slater, Corey Stoll, Merritt Wever and Rachel Zegler."

254,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Sep-23,"On September 1, the SAG-AFTRA National Board voted to send the video game strike authorization vote to its members, and on September 25, the results showed the authorization passed with 98.32% voting in favor.After the WGA and AMPTP reached a tentative agreement on September 24, leading to the official end of the WGA strike on September 27, SAG-AFTRA announced that it remains on strike, and called for renewed negotiations with the AMPTP. Later on September 27, SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP made a joint announcement that ""SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP will resume negotiations for a new TV/Theatrical contract on Monday, October 2."""
255,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Oct-23,"On October 2, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP met for negotiations, in the first meeting between the two unions since the SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14. Unlike the WGA's negotiations, the SAG-AFTRA's negotiations were held at SAG-AFTRA's headquarters on Wilshire Boulevard rather than the AMPTP's headquarters in Sherman Oaks as, according to Deadline, SAG-AFTRA officials were displeased ""with the AMPTP's setup"" and wanted a change of scenery. Participants included AMPTP chief Carol Lombardini, Donna Langley (NBCUniversal), David Zaslav (Warner Bros. Discovery), Ted Sarandos (Netflix), Bob Iger (Disney), as well as SAG-AFTRA's Fran Drescher, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, and Ray Rodriguez. The meeting concluded with an announcement that they would meet again on the 4th. This pattern continued from October 4 to 9, when a joint statement announced a meeting on October 11. However, negotiations broke down on October 11.Beginning October 12, numerous reasons were given as to why negotiations stopped. Sarandos said that talks broke down because SAG-AFTRA ""introduced a levy on subscribers on top of [other] areas"" which he said was ""a bridge too far."" However, SAG-AFTRA accused the AMPTP of using ""bully tactics"", with SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher, stating that the AMPTP ""had given us a proposal package. We worked for like 36 hours on it. We brought it back to them. We walked them through it and they left and then called a few hours later and said, 'We're breaking negotiations.'"" Drescher has also said that SAG-AFTRA wants to continue negotiations. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland (SAG-AFTRA) also responded stating that, ""the public statement from the CEOs in their press release from the AMPTP characterized our demands as excessive. But really we don't think they are. The numbers they've been using are wildly overstated.""On October 16, SAG-AFTRA announced that it will schedule negotiations regarding a new video game contract.On October 19, Deadline Hollywood reported that a Zoom call between Hollywood stars (George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson, Kerry Washington, Tyler Perry, Bradley Cooper, Meryl Streep, Jennifer Aniston, Robert De Niro, Ben Affleck, Laura Dern, Emma Stone, Reese Witherspoon, Ryan Reynolds, and Ariana DeBose) and SAG-AFTRA leaders introduced a proposal that ""amounts to the town's biggest earners defraying the costs to AMPTP signatories by eliminating the cap on membership dues, to be used to bolster health benefits and other areas that SAG-AFTRA is trying to shore up. The offer would remove the $1 million cap on membership dues,"" and ultimately would have brought $150 million over three years. While Crabtree-Ireland found the proposal ""worthy of review and consideration"" as ""someone wanting to help is not someone wanting to undermine,"" Drescher ultimately rejected the offer, saying that it is not feasible. She instead called upon the AMPTP to resume negotiations with SAG-AFTRA.On October 20, actress and former SAG president Melissa Gilbert dismissed a message from SAG-AFTRA stating that actors should not wear Halloween costumes of characters from ""struck companies,"" and said: ""THIS is what you guys come up with? Literally no one cares what anyone wears for Halloween ... do you really think this kind of infantile stuff is going to end the strike? ... please tell me you're going to make this rule go away... and go negotiate!... people are suffering mightily... this is the kind of silly bullshit that keeps us on strike.""On October 21, a joint statement announced that negotiations would resume on October 24, 2023. After a full day of negotiations on the 24th, the initial plan of meeting on October 25 was moved to October 26. Negotiations thus resumed on October 26, with Crabtree-Ireland stating that they are ""100% focused on making a fair deal at the table ... I am cautiously optimistic that can happen. I don't really want to characterize what's going on in the room but we're really focused on just staying prepared and focused on getting the negotiations done."" An individual also speculated to The Wrap that ""studios believe that if they can’t reach a deal in the next week with the Screen Actors Guild, which has been on strike since July 14, then no new production will be able to start before 2024."" After the meeting, they announced that negotiations will continue on October 27. Also on October 26, a public letter signed by thousands of high-profile actors was sent to the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee encouraging them to keep fighting for their values rather than cave in to the studios' demands, saying, ""As hard as this is, we would rather stay on strike than take a bad deal.""On October 27, 2023, negotiations continued, but no deal was made, and it was announced that talks will continue over the weekend. The four studio CEOs did not attend the meeting, and Lombardini attended in their stead. The meeting on October 28 was conducted virtually between SAG-AFTRA leaders Drescher, Crabtree-Ireland and the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee, with the guild awaiting a response from the studios, and plans to meet again on October 29.Then, after intermittent communications on October 29, a guild source told Deadline Hollywood that there ""is a feeling of optimism... looks like we're in the final stretch."" Deadline also states that ""both sides expressed confidence a deal may be reached within days, but as before cautioned the situation is still fluid. From our understanding, SAG-AFTRA and the studios have gained 'significant' traction on bridging their gap over what has been termed as success-based compensation for streaming shows and their casts."" Late in the evening SAG-AFTRA  stated: ""Both parties will be working independently Monday and re-engage on scheduling at the end of the day."" The next day, Crabtree-Ireland informed Deadline that the weekend talks were ""productive,"" and he continues to remain ""cautiously optimistic about making progress."" Also according to Deadline, he said that SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP are ""not just 'dotting I's and crossing T's' just yet... He added that AI is the current focus of talks."" Later in the afternoon a ""well-positioned individual"" told Deadline Hollywood that ""There's still a lot of work to be done."" Another source told Deadline, ""there's a lot of common ground now, and we are building on that... details still have to be determined, but we're heading in the right direction."" That evening, SAG-AFTRA released a statement saying they would meet again on October 31.On October 31, talks ended early out of consideration of families celebrating Halloween, with the intention to meet again on November 1, and with plans to have further meetings later in the week if needed."
256,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Nov-23,"Meetings continued from November 1 to November 3. On November 4, SAG-AFTRA lead negotiators stated that they ""received an offer today from the AMPTP, which they characterized as their 'Last, Best, and Final Offer' ... we are reviewing it and considering our response within the context of the critical issues addressed in our proposals."" On November 5, SAG-AFTRA sent a statement to its members saying that the negotiating team had ""analyzed and thoroughly discussed the AMPTP's counter proposal all day and well into the night and will continue our deliberations on Monday.""  On November 6, SAG-AFTRA sent a letter to members that said: ""This morning our negotiators formally responded to the AMPTP’s 'Last, Best & Final' offer ... there are several essential items on which we still do not have an agreement, including AI."" Later that evening, Deadline Hollywood reported that the virtual meeting ended late, with plans to continue negotiations. A studio insider told Deadline that, ""this was a productive session, some work still required before there’s a deal."" On November 7, SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP met again. A ""guild source"" told Deadline Hollywood that they ""are very close ... not done yet, but very close with strong protection language in place."" However, the meeting ended without a deal, and with plans to continue talking on November 8. In addition, Deadline Hollywood reported that it ""heard from several sources that guild president Fran Drescher was pinged by A-list stars asking about whether a deal was nigh."" Also on November 7, Tyler Perry gave an interview on CBS Mornings. While praising the SAG-AFTRA lead negotiators, he also stated that the work stoppage has been ""debilitating,"" and that ""it's really important to know when we've won. This is only a three-year deal. In two years, two-and-a-half years, we'll be renegotiating again ... so we have to know what have we won, and what have we won for now? That's the thing. For now. [...] If I had ran my business trying to get everything at once, I wouldn't be here. I've got as much as I can for now, so let's see what we can do next.""On November 8, 2023, SAG-AFTRA released a statement to its members that announced the end of the strike: “We are thrilled and proud to tell you that today your TV/Theatrical Negotiating Committee voted unanimously to approve a tentative agreement with the AMPTP. As of 12:01am on November 9, our strike is officially suspended and all picket locations are closed."" The SAG-AFTRA's National Board committee then approved the agreement by a majority of 86%. The summary of the agreement would be published on November 13, 2023. Voting among SAG-AFTRA members began on November 14 and is scheduled to conclude on December 5."
257,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Strike activity and responses,Locations,"SAG-AFTRA's strikes in Los Angeles targeted the major film studios as well as offices for companies. Drescher personally joined the strikes outside of Netflix's offices. Josh Gad was among the protestors at Fox Entertainment's picket lines. Allison Janney, Kaitlyn Dever, Logan Lerman, and Joey King joined protests at Warner Bros., and actresses Constance Zimmer and Ginnifer Goodwin took part in picket lines at Paramount's Los Angeles studios. Disney's offices saw picket lines whose notable members included Mandy Moore, Michelle Monaghan, Raini and Rico Rodriguez, Danielle Fishel, and Ben Schwartz.SAG-AFTRA's New York picketing action took place at Paramount's New York headquarters at 1515 Broadway and various offices of NBCUniversal, including Rockefeller Center. Jason Sudeikis joined the NBCUniversal picket lines, stating that actors would strike for ""as long as it takes"", as did Joe Pantoliano, the Naked Cowboy, Alex Edelman, and Sarah Sherman. Meanwhile, at Paramount's headquarters, picket lines included Michael Schur and Kevin Bacon.SAG-AFTRA also staged brief strikes at other locations outside of New York and Los Angeles.

264,Sourdough Fire,Summary,,"The Sourdough Fire is an ongoing wildfire in Whatcom County, Washington, in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was reported on July 29, 2023, near Sourdough Mountain in North Cascades National Park and was likely caused by an earlier lightning strike. The fire caused the closure of the North Cascades Highway (State Route 20) and evacuations of recreational facilities and three Seattle City Light hydroelectric dams in the area. As of September 15, the Sourdough Fire is estimated to have burned 6,369 acres (2,577 ha) and is 25 percent contained."
265,Sourdough Fire,History,,"The Sourdough Fire was first reported on July 29, 2023, three days after a thunderstorm in the area with lightning strikes that caused nearby fires. It is named for Sourdough Mountain in North Cascades National Park. The fire grew to over 1,440 acres (580 ha) by August 4 and prompted the immediate closure of the North Cascades Highway (State Route 20) between Newhalem and Rainy Pass. It was initially reported on August 5 to be nearly 3,000 acres (1,200 ha) but the estimate was revised down with the use of more accurate mapping. The North Cascades Highway reopened on August 9, but closed again two days later due to increased fire activity near the road.Evacuations were ordered at several campsites and recreational facilities in the park around Diablo Lake. By August 11, the fire burned approximately 1,809 acres (732 ha) and was 5 percent contained with 411 firefighters, 6 helicopters, and several aircraft dispatched to the area. The Sourdough Mountain Lookout, a historic fire lookout tower atop the mountain, was wrapped in fireproof material to protect it from damage. The fire generated a large pyrocumulus cloud on August 4 that was visible from the Puget Sound region.Fire officials expect the Sourdough Fire to continue southeast towards Diablo Lake and Gorge Lake and potentially west where ""more continuous fuels exist"". The fire, described as ""long-duration"", is not expected to be contained until October due to warm temperatures and low humidity. The community of Diablo is expected to remain under evacuation orders, along with the Diablo Dam. Seattle City Light plans to continue operating the three hydroelectric dams in the area and suspended its tours of Diablo Lake. During evacuations of staff on August 2, the Diablo and Ross dams went offline while Gorge Dam continued with reduced output of about 50 percent; and several transmission lines were also shut down to prevent shorting. Power generation at the Diablo and Ross dams resumed on August 9.The fire was directed west towards Newhalem by firefighters using ""burnout techniques""; the area near Newhalem includes burn scars from a 2015 wildfire that would slow progress. The strategy was paused after a red flag warning was issued by the National Weather Service for the Diablo area with a high temperature of 104 °F (40 °C) recorded on August 13. Smoke from the fire moved southwest into the Puget Sound region, including Seattle, on August 13 and caused worsened air quality readings. The smoke from the Sourdough Fire and other fires in Washington and British Columbia returned to the Puget Sound region the following week and caused the air quality index in Seattle to reach 190 on August 20, the worst among major cities globally.The North Cascades Highway reopened on August 23 for through travelers, with stops prohibited and recreation areas remaining closed due to the Sourdough and Blue Lake fires. It closed a day later and was reopened on August 30 for travel with pilot vehicles to direct traffic. The North Cascades Institute cancelled all of their programs for 2023 as a result of the fire, which forced their on-site employees to evacuate from dormitories. Management of the Sourdough Fire was transferred from the Northwest Incident Management Team 8 to the National Park Service on August 29 following successful containment measures. The fire's spread slowed after rainfall in early September as containment reached 25 percent; several campsites and recreation areas in the North Cascades National Park Complex were reopened on September 11 due to improved conditions."

268,SummerSlam (2023),Production,Storylines,"The event included matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

This resulted in a match at Backlash that Rhodes won. A rematch occurred at Night of Champions, which Lesnar won via submission die to Rhodes passing out to the Kimura Lock submission. Due to Rhodes and Lesnar having 1 win each, and the fact that Rhodes passed out and did not give up, Rhodes issued an open challenge to Lesnar for anytime, anywhere on the following episode of Raw. Lesnar returned on the July 3 episode, where he brawled with Rhodes. The following week, Rhodes challenged Lesnar to a third match at SummerSlam. After viciously attacking Rhodes on the next episode, Lesnar accepted the challenge.At Money in the Bank, Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Finn Bálor after Judgment Day stablemate, Damian Priest, who had won the men's Money in the Bank ladder match earlier that night, accidentally distracted Bálor. On the following episode of Raw, in a match between Rollins and Judgment Day's ""Dirty"" Dominik Mysterio, Priest attacked Rollins, thus Rollins won by disqualification. As Priest attempted to cash in his Money in the Bank contract, Bálor appeared and attacked Rollins, costing Priest his opportunity, which caused some disagreement between Bálor and Priest. The following week, arguments between Bálor and Priest intensified, however, both Bálor and Priest agreed that Bálor should receive a title match first. Later, The Judgment Day defeated Rollins' team in a six-man tag team match. On the July 17 episode, Bálor challenged Rollins to a rematch for the title, however, Rollins declined and stated that they could settle their differences that night without the title as both had issues with each other. As Bálor seemingly left, he viciously attacked Rollins. A match between the two for the World Heavyweight Championship was then scheduled for SummerSlam.At Night of Champions, Asuka defeated Bianca Belair to win the Raw Women's Championship. As a result of the 2023 WWE Draft, the title was drafted to SmackDown and on the June 9 episode of SmackDown, Asuka was presented with a new championship belt to resolve the issue, and the title reverted to its original name of WWE Women's Championship. Prior to the presentation, WWE official Adam Pearce requested Belair not to interrupt, who stated that she wanted a rematch for the title.

Jey would also leave The Bloodline on the June 16 episode of SmackDown, where he attacked Reigns and Sikoa, choosing to stand by his brother Jimmy's side. This led to a ""Bloodline Civil War"" tag team match at Money in the Bank, where The Usos defeated Reigns and Sikoa with Jey pinning Reigns, which was the first time Reigns was pinned since TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs in December 2019. On the following SmackDown, a trial for Reigns was held where Reigns feigned that he did not want to be the Tribal Chief any longer and attacked Jey with a low blow.

Jey turned his back on Jimmy, prompting the latter to leave the ring. Reigns proceeded to mock Jey for being emotional, which led to him attacking Reigns and Solo Sikoa in retaliation. Just as it seemed Jey was about to forgive Jimmy, he attacked his twin with a Superkick for his betrayal. He then declared that he was quitting WWE following the mess within the Bloodline. However, Jey would move to Raw at Payback a few weeks later."

284,2023 Union Square riot,Summary,,"On August 4, 2023, at approximately 4 p.m. EDT, Internet personality Kai Cenat held a purported giveaway of gaming-related items in Union Square, Manhattan. An unknown number of the thousands of participants at the giveaway began to engage in civil unrest in Union Square Park. Cenat was taken into police custody by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) during the riot and was charged with inciting a riot and unlawful assembly."
285,2023 Union Square riot,Background,,"Kai Cenat is an American livestreamer and YouTuber. In 2020, he joined Any Means Possible (AMP), a collective of content creators. The following year, he gained popularity after a series of livestreams featuring artists such as Drake, 21 Savage, Toosii and Lil Baby. In February 2023, during a subathon—an event in which a livestreamer continuously streams in an attempt to gain paid subscribers, Cenat joined United Talent Agency. At the end of the subathon, he had amassed 300,000 Twitch subscribers, a record for the platform. As of August 2023, Cenat has a cumulative 11.1 million followers across YouTube and Twitch.In the days preceding the gathering, Cenat announced that he would give away PlayStation 5 consoles at 4 p.m. in Union Square along 14th Street, joined by Fanum, Duke Dennis and Agent00, three Twitch streamers. All four men are members of the streaming group AMP. In a live stream on August 2, he claimed that he would give away gift cards, headphones, gaming chairs, computers, webcams, keyboards, and microphones to attendees who could correctly answer questions about YouTube and live streaming. He called this mission ""get off the streets and go stream"". The video was viewed two million times. Cenat did not have a permit for the gathering. On the day of the giveaway, he posted on Twitter that he would be live streaming the event at 3:30 p.m."
286,2023 Union Square riot,Giveaway and subsequent riot,,"By 1:30 p.m. the area was filled with fans. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) became aware of the gathering at the same time, as several people began converging. By 3 p.m., a large crowd had gathered in Union Square, partially drawn to the event by further word of the giveaway outside Cenat's fans. By 3:30 p.m., the NYPD had mobilized several officers to the area and established a perimeter; the group took down barriers and conflict broke out between police and members of the crowd. Members of the crowd climbed up a gazebo, street signs, vehicles including a bus, and a George Washington statue, with some throwing bottles at officers and other objects at car windows. According to claims by the NYPD, individuals walked around with shovels and axes from a nearby construction site and lit off fireworks. A CBS New York helicopter recorded a man using a fire extinguisher on a crowd of people.The NYPD called on an estimated one thousand officers to respond as part of a level four mobilization, according to a spokesperson. This is the highest level of disaster response that the NYPD uses. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority had New York City Subway trains bypass the 14th Street–Union Square station. A nearby Best Buy, an eyeglass shop, and the Union Square Greenmarket were forced to close early. At least two thousand people appeared at the event in total, though police estimate that three to five thousand people were present. Cenat appeared in a black SUV on a livestream with gift cards worth US$100 and claimed that police were throwing tear gas. Seconds later, he exited the SUV and was swarmed by fans. The NYPD pushed the crowd north as crowds began dispersing. On 19th Street, a group collectively took a knee and started a ""Black Lives Matter"" chant. An upscale restaurant was forced to close on 20th Street as another group sat on wicker chairs, and dozens stormed a CVS Pharmacy on 22nd Street, distributing water and snacks. By 5:30 p.m., the number of participants had begun to decrease, with the police eventually blocking the entrances."
287,2023 Union Square riot,Injuries,,"At least nine people were injured according to the NYPD. Four victims were transferred to Mount Sinai Beth Israel, while two others were transferred to Lenox Hill Hospital. Three officers were injured, including the NYPD chief Jeffrey Maddrey. According to Maddrey, several people exited the crowd bleeding and with panic attacks. One officer was reportedly severely beaten. A witness reported not being able to breathe. Maddrey also reported that a 17-year-old was wounded by a large firecracker."
288,2023 Union Square riot,Aftermath,,"At approximately 5:00 p.m., Cenat was taken into police custody. The NYPD charged him with inciting a riot and unlawful assembly. According to Maddrey, police ""loaded up a city bus"" with people; at least 65 people at the event were arrested, including 30 juveniles. The bus was attacked by other people attempting to pull people off. In a press conference, Maddrey claimed that multiple police cars and food carts had been destroyed. The incident polarized Internet users and became an Internet meme. Rapper Offset criticized the police for arresting Cenat. A video spread on social media depicted two police officers smashing a man in a red sweatshirt's head into a taxi window. The Civilian Complaint Review Board is currently looking into four incidents, including the altercation with the man in the red sweatshirt. An NYPD investigation is ongoing.Kai Cenat appeared in court on August 16, following his release from police custody on August 5. He appeared in court again on August 18."
289,2023 Union Square riot,Response,,"At a press conference, Maddrey stated, ""When I go back later on this evening, I will have an after-action determine exactly what our steps were. We can't allow this to happen again in the future"". New York City mayor Eric Adams praised police for their ""quick work"" in dispersing the crowd.In a statement on August 5, streaming group AMP apologized for the riot. In his first appearance since the riot, Cenat held up a New York Daily News issue covering the riot and apologized in a livestream on August 9, while also announcing that he would take a break from livestreaming. He resumed streaming by September 16, where he sparked a cheating controversy between Offset and his wife Cardi B."
290,2023 Union Square riot,Analysis,,"The incident generated discourse about the implications surrounding the influence of internet personalities. Following the event, Adams stated in a press briefing that ""children cannot be raised by social media"", while researcher Megan Moreno stated in an NPR interview that the incident ""does speak to how much investment people can place within these parasocial relationships"". In a Wired article comparing the event to similar Internet-based incidents, University of Sydney lecturer Mark Johnson offered a similar viewpoint about the role of social media, such as the interactivity of Twitch, on the relationships between streamers and their fans. Johnson also described the occurrence as an example of ""emergent behavior"", where internet users transition from interacting online to entering the real world. The article also claimed that Cenat was the ""first Twitch streamer to be charged with inciting a riot"". Writing for The Wall Street Journal, journalist James Freeman wrote that Cenat had the opportunity to mend relations with police."
291,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Summary,,"From May 2 to September 27, 2023, the Writers Guild of America (WGA)—representing 11,500 screenwriters—went on strike over a labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The 148-day strike was the longest interruption to American film and television production since the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the second longest labor stoppage that the WGA has performed since the strike of 1988, which lasted for 153 days. Along with the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, which continued until November 9 at 12:01 a.m. PDT., it was part of a series of broader Hollywood labor disputes.
The lack of ongoing film and television productions resulted in some studios having to close doors or reduce staff. The strike also jeopardized long-term contracts created during the media streaming boom: big studios could terminate production deals with writers through force majeure clauses after 90 days, saving them millions of dollars. In addition, numerous other areas within the global entertainment ecosystem were impacted by the strike action, including the VFX industry and prop making studios. Following a tentative agreement, union leadership voted to end the strike on September 27, 2023. On October 9, the WGA membership officially ratified the contract with 99% of WGA members voting in favor of it. Its combined impact with the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike resulted in the loss of 45,000 jobs, and ""an estimated $6.5 billion"" loss to the economy of Southern California."
292,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Issues in the strike,,"One of the main focus points in the labor dispute is the residuals from streaming media; the WGA claims that AMPTP's share of such residuals has cut much of the writers' average incomes compared to a decade ago. Writers also wanted artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, to be used only as a tool that can help with research or facilitate script ideas and not as a tool to replace them. The COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath saw major reductions in the workforce and cancellations of multiple film and television productions to save money on basic residuals and music licensing costs, though Apple and Amazon remained outliers. The ensuing fall of ""Peak TV"" created worsening conditions for writers, as well as actors.On May 2, 2020, the latest Minimum Basic Agreement (MBA) became the collective bargaining agreement that covered most of the work done by WGA writers. The Minimum Basic Agreement was an agreement that established a minimum wage for television and film writers. In television, the Minimum Basic Agreement only applied to those who wrote for broadcast television shows and not for streaming television. This was very clear when comparing late-night talk shows that were produced for broadcast television, such as The Late Show with Stephen Colbert by CBS, versus The Problem with Jon Stewart, produced for streaming by Apple TV+. The writers who worked for The Problem were not covered by the MBA and therefore had to negotiate individually with the streaming company for their pay, and as a result, they were paid less than writers who wrote for The Late Show while doing the same amount of work. This pattern held true with other shows in the two categories. The MBA expired on May 1, 2023.The WGA estimated that its proposals would yield writers about US$429 million a year, whereas the AMPTP's offer would yield $86 million.One disputed issue is the Guild wanting requirements for ""mandatory staffing"" and ""duration of employment"" terms to be added to their contract, which would require all shows to be staffed with a minimum number of writers for a minimum amount of time, ""whether needed or not"" per the AMPTP.Another important proposal that the WGA is advocating for is to ensure each member of a writing team receives their own pension and their own health care funds. The AMPTP rejected this proposal and did not offer a counterproposal. At the same time, there was a tentative agreement between the WGA and AMPTP to have 0.5% of negotiated minimums for all WGA minimums shifted into pensions and health funds."
293,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Apr-23,"On April 18, 2023, 97.85% of members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) voted to go on strike if they failed to reach a satisfactory agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major film and television studios in Hollywood, by May 1. The AMPTP engaged in lengthy negotiations with the WGA on behalf of Amazon Studios (as well as MGM Holdings), Apple Studios, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Paramount Global, Sony Pictures, the Walt Disney Company, and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), but failed to reach a deal before the mandated deadline."
294,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,May-23,"As a result, the leadership of the Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) and Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) unanimously approved a strike on the eve of May 2, the first of its kind since the 2007–2008 strike fifteen years prior.The Hollywood Reporter reported that the WGA had set some prospective rules for writers during the strike. The Writers Guild stated that ""writers cannot do any writing, revising, pitching, or discussing future projects with companies that are members of the AMPTP.""The Writers Guild also stated that fiction podcasts that are produced by companies against which the Guild and its members are striking must stop production. The Guild said that they hoped that writers of animated series not covered by the Writers Guild but by the Animation Guild would seek advice from the Writers Guild on whether or not their work as a writer was counter to the activities of the strike and, if so, to cease such work for the duration of the strike. The Guild noted that while they cannot punish non-Guild writers who write for companies against which the union is striking, they promise to bar such writers from future Guild membership.The WGA instructed members to begin picketing on May 2, 2023, at 1:00 p.m. PDT.  Some places that the WGA has picketed include AMC Networks, Amazon/Culver Studios, MGM, CBS Radford, CBS Television City, Disney, 20th Century Studios, Lionsgate, Starz, Netflix, Paramount, MTV, Sony, Universal, Warner Bros. (including its Burbank division), 30 Rock/NBCUniversal, Broadway Stages, HBO, Silvercup Studios, Steiner Studios, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Warner Bros. Discovery Upfront.During the strike, the WGA instructed writers facing financial hardship due to the strike to apply to the Entertainment Community Fund. The Entertainment Community Fund helps people in the entertainment industry with financial trouble find affordable housing and maintain health care and senior care coverage. On May 10, 2023, it was reported that writers had pledged $1.7 million to the Entertainment Community Fund. Among the prominent donors were showrunners and producers J. J. Abrams, Greg Berlanti, Adam McKay, Ryan Murphy, Shonda Rhimes, Michael Schur, and John Wells."
295,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Jun-23,"On June 7 and 8, 2023, picketing in the Northeast (namely in New York) was paused due to poor air quality from the 2023 Canadian wildfires. Strike activity resumed on the 9th when air quality improved.On June 9, 2023, Lionsgate suspended BMF line producer Ian Woolf following an altercation with striking writers who were picketing outside of BMF's production headquarters. According to first-hand accounts from writers Gabriel Alejandro Garza and Tom Smuts, Woolf attempted to intimidate Garza and Brian Egeston, who were picketing on the sidewalk next to the studio's entrance, by accelerating his car towards them and stopping just short of hitting them. After first claiming that he did not see them, Woolf later admitted to trying to scare them. According to Smuts, Woolf later unsuccessfully tried to convince Teamsters Local 728 to cross picket lines, but they refused. Lionsgate released a statement saying, ""We take acts of intimidation and threats of violence seriously and investigate them thoroughly... As we continue to investigate, we have sent home the individual involved."" The WGA also released a statement, which read, ""Workers should not be threatened with physical harm when exercising their right to publicly protest and picket against unfair wages and working conditions."""
296,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Jul-23,"On July 12, 2023, Deadline Hollywood reported that the AMPTP and the major Hollywood studios did not plan to return to negotiations with the WGA until late October 2023 at the earliest. The studio executives who anonymously spoke with Deadline stated that by October, many writers would be financially strained to the point where they would lose their housing, which they believed would allow them to be in a better position to dictate the terms of any new deal. Representatives for the AMPTP distanced themselves from the anonymous sources, claiming they remained committed to signing a deal as soon as possible."
297,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Aug-23,"On August 1, 2023, the WGA announced that it would meet with the AMPTP on the following Friday to discuss negotiations regarding the strike. The location of the meeting was not disclosed. A spokesman for the AMPTP, speaking in relation to the strikes of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA, said, ""we remain committed to finding a path to mutually beneficial deals with both unions."" Both parties met on August 4, 2023, but no agreement was reached.On August 10, 2023, the AMPTP and the WGA agreed to resume contract negotiations, with the first meeting set for August 11. After that meeting, the Writers Guild sent a note to its 11,500 members saying the AMPTP had indicated a willingness to make concessions in some areas, including finding ways to safeguard writers from artificial intelligence technology. The note added, however, that the AMPTP had said studios ""were not willing to engage"" on other Writers Guild proposals, including success-based residual payments from streaming services. The note said guild leaders would not return to negotiations until studios were willing to engage on all proposals. However, the WGA sent a message to members that evening saying that they had received a counterproposal and were evaluating it.On August 21, 2023, picketing was canceled in Los Angeles due to Hurricane Hilary. The union, meanwhile, remained relatively silent beyond the message of August 18, 2023: ""Everybody is trying to step up and make a resolution,"" one executive told THR. ""There's more positive momentum this week than last."" On August 22, 2023, AMPTP presented a proposal suggesting rules for AI content, but talks between the studios and the writers remained at a stalemate until late September. On August 30, California State Treasurer Fiona Ma sent letters to Netflix, The Walt Disney Company, Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery, Apple Inc., Paramount Global and Amazon, telling them to return to negotiations and settle the strikes. She states that the impact of the strikes ""paralyzes Hollywood and reverberates across the state, affecting countless businesses, thousands of pension fund beneficiaries, and millions of Californians."""
298,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Sep-23,"On September 6, Warner Bros. suspended deals with Mindy Kaling, J. J. Abrams, Greg Berlanti, and Bill Lawrence. It had announced the day before that the strikes would impact its 2023 earnings by $500 million.On September 8, the WGA released a statement claiming that there are member companies that have shown a ""desire and willingness to negotiate an agreement that adequately addresses writers' issues... [and who] have said they are willing to negotiate on proposals that the AMPTP has presented to the public as deal breakers,"" and that they have asked them to leave the AMPTP in order to negotiate independently with the WGA. A few hours later, the AMPTP released a statement refuting that claim, saying, ""The AMPTP member companies are aligned and are negotiating together to reach a resolution. Any suggestion to the contrary is false.""On September 11, 2023, The Drew Barrymore Show resumed episodes without writers and was picketed by guild members. Two audience members were turned away for wearing WGA pins. Barrymore would be removed as host of the upcoming 74th National Book Awards the following day. On September 17, Barrymore changed her decision and announced that the show would remain on hiatus while the strike was ongoing.On September 12, in an interview with TheWrap, a studio executive said that ""the showrunners are quite pissed [...] they are mad at the guilds and feel that they are not responding to the studios' offer. Now even the higher-paid members of the guild are expressing concern over the inability to end the strike."" In addition, while there were plans for a meeting between the WGA and top showrunners on September 15, the meeting was cancelled on that day due to plans for an upcoming meeting between the WGA and AMPTP the following week.On September 13, American comedian and political commentator Bill Maher announced on Twitter that he will resume production of his show Real Time with Bill Maher. However, on September 18, Maher changed his mind, stating: ""My decision to return to work was made when it seemed nothing was happening and there was no end in sight to this strike. Now that both sides have agreed to go back to the negotiating table I'm going to delay the return of Real Time, for now, and hope they can finally get this done."" Earlier in September, he suggested that the Governor of California Gavin Newsom should help end the strike.On September 14, the AMPTP said that the WGA met with them the previous day and agreed to restart negotiations the following week. A few minutes after the news, the WGA confirmed this. Four days later, it was announced that the union and studios would resume negotiations on September 20 with studio CEOs Bob Iger (Disney), David Zaslav (Warner Bros. Discovery), Ted Sarandos (Netflix), and Donna Langley (Universal Pictures). This meeting was followed by more meetings on September 21, 22, and 23. Finally, the writers and the studios reached a tentative agreement on September 24, and on September 26, following a vote, the union leadership announced that the strike would officially end. The strike ended on September 27 at 12:01 a.m. PDT."

The projects that have been unaffected either were already written before May 2, are largely unscripted, or rely on non-union staff.Still, other projects with completed scripts have been postponed or canceled due to the union's use of picket lines to disrupt those productions."
302,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Response,Actors during the WGA strike,"SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher and executive vice president Ben Whitehair picketed with the WGA in May.

At a WGA rally on May 3, 2023, Lindsay Dougherty, the leader of Teamsters Local 399, said that while the Teamsters could not strike in solidarity due to a contract in place through 2024, she affirmed that Local 399 would not cross picket lines, saying, ""Every single truck that we know of has not crossed.""On May 2, 2023, The Animation Guild, IATSE Local 839 made a statement of support for the Writers Guild and their strike.

The union also advised writers ""You should not write anything normally written by striking WGA writers."""
305,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Response,Film and television executives,"On May 3, 2023, the second day of the strike, The Walt Disney Company (through its ABC Signature Studios unit) sent a letter written by the studios' Assistant Chief Counsel Bob McPhail on behalf of the executives at Disney to showrunners and all other writer-producers who work for the company, saying that they must report back to work and perform their non-writer duties. Producers are expected to do what are known as ""a through h"" services, like cutting for time, making small changes to dialogue or narration, and ""changes in technical or stage directions.""On May 4, 2023, on the Q1 earnings call for Paramount, CEO Bob Bakish addressed the strike, saying that writers were ""an essential part of creating content"" and that he hoped there could be ""a resolution that works for everyone fairly quickly"". Bakish also stated that the company had been planning for an extended strike and shared that the company's strategy to outlast the writers' strike is to use its large streaming library located within Paramount+, the upcoming summer movie slate, which will move to the streaming service, and productions that will be completed offshore.On July 11, 2023, Deadline Hollywood reported that the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers was seeking to use a ""divide and conquer"" approach among the different Hollywood unions, including the WGA. The article said that the AMPTP would not negotiate with the WGA until October at the earliest and quoted one studio executive as saying, ""The endgame is to allow things to drag on until union members start losing their apartments and losing their houses."" The article and quote received attention and backlash from both Hollywood outlets, such as Entertainment Tonight, and non-Hollywood outlets, such as Vanity Fair and the New York Daily News. When asked about the guild's demands for staffing minimums and guaranteed employment periods, AMPTP president Carol Lombardini responded by saying that ""writers are lucky to have term employment.""AMC Theatres CEO Adam Aron said of the WGA strike that only a prolonged strike lasting many months would impact the theater chain and that most of the movies to be released in 2023 and 2024 have already been written and even filmed.Warner Bros. Discovery CEO and president David Zaslav said that WBD and other Hollywood studios were ""not glad"" that the WGA strike had occurred and that the company was working to resolve the strike and compensate writers fairly."
306,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Response,Strikebreaking efforts,"During the strike, several celebrities announced a desire to strikebreak by resuming to film or promote amidst ongoing negotiations. However, they all ultimately changed their minds after public backlash.

In July 2023, Canadian actor Stephen Amell said he did not support striking at a fan convention, calling the strike a ""reductive negotiating tactic"" and ""myopic"". Amell apologized for what he said in a Instagram post and attended a New York City picket line.
On September 10, 2023, The Drew Barrymore Show announced it would resume filming. The WGA East condemned the action as violation of the WGA strike rules. Several days later, Drew Barrymore released on apology video on Instagram, saying, ""I deeply apologize to writers. I deeply apologize to unions."" Co-head writer of The Drew Barrymore Show, Chelsea White, one of those who picketed the series on September 12, said that when any production covered under WGA comes back ""during a strike it undermines our whole group effort to come to a fair contract with the AMPTP."" On September 17, Barrymore said that she would be halting production of the show.On September 13, 2023, Bill Maher announced that Real Time with Bill Maher would resume filming. The WGA condemned the action in a statement, stating ""Bill Maher's decision to go back on the air while his Guild is on strike is disappointing. If he goes forward with his plan, he needs to honor more than 'the spirit of the strike'. Bill Maher is obligated as a WGA member to follow the strike rules and not perform any writing services. It is difficult to imagine how Real Time with Bill Maher can go forward without a violation of WGA strike rules taking place. WGA will be picketing this show."" Maher had previously called the demands by the WGA ""kooky."" On September 18, Maher said that he is going ""to delay the return of Real Time, for now."""
307,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Notes,,
308,Killing of Ta'Kiya Young,Summary,,"On August 24, 2023, Ta'Kiya Young, a 21-year-old pregnant woman, was shot to death by a police officer in Blendon Township, Ohio after she accelerated her vehicle. The shooting occurred after police attempted to question her about alleged shoplifting from a local grocery store."
309,Killing of Ta'Kiya Young,Background,,"Ta'Kiya Young was a 21-year-old mother of two young sons, aged 6 and 3 at the time of her death; she was pregnant with a due date of November 2023. 
Two officers were involved in the shooting; they have not been identified publicly, with Blendon Township citing Marsy's Law, which requires that police withhold the names of victims of violent crimes. Police considered the officer who shot Young a potential victim of attempted vehicular assault, as he was hit by the vehicle. Police considered the other officer a potential victim of misdemeanor assault, as his arm was inside the car window when Young accelerated. Blendon Township Police Department also did not disclose for how many years each officer had worked, as it considered years of service to be an identifying marker due to the department's small size.Ohio officials continually cite Marsy's Law to explain limited release of details related to police shootings. According to The Marshall Project, law enforcement agencies in several states have increasingly used victims' rights statutes to shield the identities of officers involved in deadly use-of-force incidents, a trend that has been criticized by advocates of open governance and transparency."
310,Killing of Ta'Kiya Young,Shooting,,"Young was sitting in her car outside a Kroger grocery store around 6:30 pm when a store staff member approached nearby police and alleged that Young had stolen alcohol from the store. Young was sitting in a four-door Lexus sedan that did not have a license plate and was parked in a handicap spot. Two police officers approached the car and demanded several times that Young exit the vehicle. One officer stood near the driver's door and another stood in front of the vehicle, with his gun drawn. Young remained behind the wheel and told the officers that she did not steal anything.After about one minute Young slowly began driving away while one of the officers was near the vehicle. The officer then fired one shot through the windshield, killing Young and her unborn baby. Authorities state that both officers offered assistance to Young after the shooting, with emergency services called within ten seconds of the shooting and a trauma kit was used on Young under two minutes of the shooting. A passerby who was an emergency room doctor supported the police with medical assistance until paramedics arrived and transported Young to the hospital where she and her unborn child died from her injuries.Body camera footage of the interaction between Young and the officers has been released. An attorney representing Young's family said a witness saw Young put down bottles of alcohol as she left the store. In early September, newly released video footage appeared to show Young putting multiple bottles of alcohol into her purse and a tote bag while out of sight of the cash register. She and the two other women then allegedly left the store without paying. The tote bag full of liquor is apparently visible in police bodycam footage as they drag her injured body from the car."
311,Killing of Ta'Kiya Young,Aftermath,,"The Blendon Township police use-of-force policy provides that officers should try to move away from an approaching vehicle instead of firing their weapons. Both of the officers were placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting, although the officer who did not fire his gun has since returned to duty. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is investigating the shooting.On October 4, 2023, it was announced that Young and her unborn child's deaths had been ruled as homicides, and that the case will be presented to a grand jury to decide whether to bring charges to the officer who fired at Young."
312,Killing of Ta'Kiya Young,Response,,"Attorneys for Young's family demanded a swift indictment of the officer responsible for the killings of Young and her unborn daughter. Young's family held a candlelight vigil the day after the shooting outside of her grandmother's home to honor Young and her unborn baby.Blendon Township Chief of Police John Belford called the shooting a ""tragic situation for everyone"". A police news release claimed that the officer near the front of the vehicle was ""a victim of attempted vehicular assault"" and the other, who had a part of his arm in the driver's side window, was ""a victim of misdemeanor assault"". In response to the incident, a member of the Fraternal Order of Police said that ""A weapon is not just a firearm. A weapon is also a 2,000-pound vehicle that somebody puts into gear and is driving at you."""

332,United States abortion protests (2022–present),Summary,,"A series of ongoing protests supporting abortion rights and anti-abortion counter-protests began in the United States on May 2, 2022, following the leak of a draft majority opinion for the U.S. Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which stated that the Constitution of the United States does not confer any Reproductive rights, thus overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court officially overturned Roe and Casey in Dobbs, resulting in further protests outside of the U.S. Supreme Court building and across the country, eventually to major cities across the world both in favor of and against the decision."
333,United States abortion protests (2022–present),Background,Leaked draft opinion,"On May 2, 2022, Politico released a first draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, the authenticity of which Politico said it had verified. The draft opinion would overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey if held by the majority and thereby finalized in that form. Alito's draft decision called the Roe decision ""egregiously wrong from the start"" on the grounds that abortion is not listed in the United States Constitution as a protected right, and instead would allow states to decide on abortion restrictions or guarantees under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.Shortly after the release of the document, multiple protests occurred in cities throughout the country and outside the U.S. Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C., along with multiple individuals such as lawyers, politicians, and activist groups speaking out about the leaked draft. The Supreme Court is typically very careful about any information being leaked, this added to the shock that many people felt when it was released."
334,United States abortion protests (2022–present),Background,Overturning of Roe v. Wade,"On June 24, 2022, in a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court officially overturned Roe v.

341,United States abortion protests (2022–present),Response,About protests outside private homes,"After protests outside of the homes of Justices John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh in early May 2022, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki tweeted that while President Joe Biden was a strong believer in the constitutional right to protest, it should never include violence, threats, or vandalism. Psaki added that Judges were a highly important function in the United States and must be able to do their jobs without concern for personal safety. The U.S. Capitol Police and the National Fusion Center Association alerted to potential violence in Washington, D.C., against the nine justices and their staffs as well as nationwide against abortion-related advocacy groups and First Amendment-protected events. In May, senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced legislation to allow Supreme Court Police to provide all nine justices and their families 24-hour protection. The bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives on June 14 in a 396–27 vote, with opposition from some New Jersey Democrats who wished to broaden the bill to also protect the family members of Supreme Court staff, and was signed into law by President Biden on June 16.Republicans argued that those protests violate a 1950 federal law that criminalizes attempting to influence a judge in the course of their official duties by demonstrating at their residence. Maryland governor Larry Hogan and Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin cited the law in a request to the U.S. Department of Justice for adequate resources to protect the justices and their families. Justice Clarence Thomas said the Supreme Court would not ""be bullied"" by the demonstrators. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) stated in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News that the protests at the Justices homes were ""mob violence to get their partisan outcome""; however, reports from both protests claimed to show no violence and about 100 protestors attending the protests.On May 16, Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed a law making it a second-degree misdemeanor to protest in front of private citizen's homes in Florida, saying, ""Sending unruly mobs to private residences, like we have seen with the angry crowds in front of the homes of Supreme Court justices, is inappropriate."" Despite the timing, the law was unrelated to the Dobbs decision, as it had been introduced two months prior."

392,Hurricane Idalia,Summary,,"Hurricane Idalia was a powerful and destructive Category 4 hurricane that caused significant damage across parts of the southeastern United States, especially in North Florida, in late August 2023. The tenth named storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, Idalia formed from a low-pressure area that crossed Central America from the eastern Pacific Ocean. Gradual development ensued as it meandered in the western part of the Caribbean Sea; the system was upgraded to a tropical depression on August 26, 2023, and strengthened into a tropical storm a day later, receiving the name Idalia. It traversed the Gulf of Mexico where it underwent rapid intensification, briefly becoming a Category 4 hurricane prior to making landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida at Category 3 strength on August 30. Idalia remained a hurricane as it moved through Northern Florida and crossed into Southeast Georgia; it then pushed into the Carolinas as a tropical storm. On August 31, Idalia emerged into the Atlantic, where it transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone that same day. Later, it passed south of Bermuda, made a counterclockwise loop, then meandered off the coast of Nova Scotia while winding down.
Idalia caused significant damage to thousands of homes, businesses, and other infrastructure along its inland path, primarily in Florida, where winds and the resulting floodwaters were highest. Its storm surge was record-breaking from the Big Bend region south to Tampa Bay. The system also spawned a tornado outbreak with around 12 confirmed tornadoes. Idalia was the most powerful hurricane to hit Florida's Big Bend region since the 1896 Cedar Keys hurricane. Four people died in storm-related incidents in the two states. Early estimates placed insured losses at $2.2–5 billion. The hurricane's remnants produced dangerous rip currents across the Eastern United States during Labor Day Weekend, resulting in several additional deaths and numerous rescues."
393,Hurricane Idalia,Meteorological history,,"On August 24, 2023, a trough of low pressure formed in the Eastern Pacific basin offshore of the Central America coast. The disturbance crossed over into the Atlantic basin the following day, and began to organize as it moved northward through the western Caribbean Sea. The pace of organization quickened on August 26, while the disturbance was located near the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula, and at 21:00 UTC it was upgraded to Tropical Depression Ten. Later that day, and into the next, the depression drifted due to weak surrounding steering currents, with its center moving in a small counterclockwise loop. The depression became Tropical Storm Idalia at 15:15 UTC on August 27, after a NOAA Hurricane Hunters flight reported that the storm's winds had increased to 40 mph (65 km/h). Early the next morning, Idalia began moving northward toward the Yucatán Channel west of Cuba, intensifying along the way despite being impacted by moderate northwesterly wind shear.
By 09:00 UTC on August 29, after passing near the western tip of Cuba, Idalia had developed an inner core and almost complete eyewall and the NHC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane. Later that day, Idalia began to rapidly intensify, reaching Category 2 strength as it benefited from exceptional conditions, with sea-surface temperatures of 88 °F (31 °C), generally low wind shear, and high relative humidity levels. Idalia continued to rapidly intensify as it accelerated northward off the Florida Suncoast and approached the Big Bend region, reaching its peak intensity of Category 4 strength on the morning of August 30, a few hours prior to landfall, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 940 mbar (27.76 inHg). This marked a wind increase of 55 mph (89 km/h) during the 24 hour period ending at 09:00 UTC on August 30, making it one of fastest rates of tropical cyclone intensification ever observed in the Atlantic basin 24 hours before landfall. At its peak, the NHC described the system as having ""a small eye surrounded by very cold clouds tops, especially in the western quadrant."" Idalia's intensification was then halted by an eyewall replacement cycle, which caused it to weaken slightly prior to landfall. Idalia made landfall at 11:45 UTC, about 20 miles (30 km) south of Perry, Florida, as a Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 949 mbar (28.02 inHg).The system quickly weakened inland as it pushed through North Florida, becoming a tropical storm later that day after crossing into Georgia. Strong southwesterly wind shear then pushed the storm's convection well north and east of its center as it moved off the northeastern South Carolina coast and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on the morning of August 31. That afternoon, Idalia transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone about 65 miles (105 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. As the storm moved to the east-southeast the following day, light wind shear along its path enabled the system to maintain its structure and intensity despite the lack of convection. The storm impacted Bermuda with tropical-storm-force winds on September 2, as it passed just to the south. Idalia's remnant low then absorbed Tropical Storm Gert on September 4 and lingered off the coast of Atlantic Canada for several days, before dissipating on September 8."
394,Hurricane Idalia,Preparations,Cuba,"More than 10,000 people were evacuated from Pinar del Río and Artemisa provinces. Patients in Bahía Honda were evacuated to a local clinic after fearing flooding."
395,Hurricane Idalia,Preparations,United States,"On August 28, hurricane warnings and storm surge warnings were issued for portions of the Florida's west coast. On August 29, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Day 1 convective outlook highlighting a level 2/slight risk of severe weather for portions of Florida associated with Idalia, with the SPC also issuing a 5 percent tornado risk. A Day 2 convective outlook was also issued concerning a level 2/slight risk and a 5 percent tornado risk for portions of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. A moderate risk of excessive rainfall was also issued by the Weather Prediction Center, for the most of the same areas included in the Day 2 Convective outlook. A tornado watch was issued for portions of western Florida on August 29, as bands of thunderstorms from Idalia moved inland.Amtrak terminated its two southbound Silver Service routes in Jacksonville, Florida on August 28 and cancelled both routes and its Auto Train service from August 29 to 30. The Palmetto route was truncated to Washington D.C. as well. At least 900 flights were cancelled across Florida and Georgia."
396,Hurricane Idalia,Preparations,Bermuda,A tropical storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August 30; this was later changed to a warning as the storm moved closer. This occurred just days after Hurricane Franklin produced tropical storm force winds to the island.
397,Hurricane Idalia,Impact,Caribbean,"The storm brought heavy rainfall to the Yucatán Peninsula. As Idalia became a tropical storm, Cayman Islands were lashed with rough seas and strong winds. Owen Roberts International Airport had recorded a peak wind gust of 35 mph (56 km/h). Idalia also brought heavy rain, reaching up to 2 inches (51 mm) causing some flooding. Flooding occurred in Güira de Melena and Guanimar in Cuba, and high winds hit Pinar del Río Province. Rainfall reached 4 inches (100 mm) across portions of the country."
398,Hurricane Idalia,Impact,United States,"As of September 25, assessed damage reached $704.1 million across Florida and Georgia. In Florida, at least 21,252 insurance claims were made with losses totaling $216.1 million. Agricultural losses reached $447 million in the state. Damage in Georgia exceeded $41 million. Estimates of total damage across the Southeastern United States vary widely from various insurance companies and catastrophe modelers. Early calculations showed possibilities of damage exceeding $9 billion and potentially reaching $20 billion, though these tempered as time passed. On September 4, Moody's Analytics reported private insured losses at $3–5 billion with a ""best estimate"" of $3.5 billion. They indicated losses attached to the National Flood Insurance Program would reach $500 million. Verisk Analytics placed the same metric at $2.5–4 billion. Karen Clark & Co. estimated losses at $2.2 billion on September 1. Of this, $2 billion was from wind-related damage and $210 million from storm surge. Regularly improving building codes across Florida are attributed with lesser damage as structures are more able to withstand the effects of hurricanes. Homes built on stilts and with properly secured roofs suffered minimal damage while older structures were severely affected.At least ten people were killed in incidents related to the hurricane: four in Florida, three in New Jersey, and one each in Delaware, Georgia, and North Carolina."
399,Hurricane Idalia,Impact,Bermuda,"On September 2, the Department of Marine and Ports Services announced that ferries were suspended until weather conditions improved, BELCO announced that Idalia had caused over 6,000 power outages, and the Department of Public Transportation announced the temporary suspension of bus services. Idalia also caused all flights to and from L.F. Wade International Airport and North America to be cancelled or delayed on September 2, with some flights also being affected the following day."
400,Hurricane Idalia,Aftermath,United States,"On August 31, 2023, President Joe Biden said that he had spoken to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and other governors about Idalia and that he had approved of their requests for disaster and emergency declarations."
401,Hurricane Idalia,Notes,,
402,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Summary,,"On September 12, 2023, Kevin McCarthy, the then-Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, announced an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. The inquiry will be conducted by the House's Judiciary, Oversight and Ways and Means committees. James Comer, chairman of the Oversight Committee, will lead the investigation.
Speaker McCarthy initiated the inquiry saying that recent House investigations ""paint a picture of corruption"" by Biden and his family. No congressional investigations have discovered any evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden himself. The first hearing of the impeachment inquiry was held on September 28, 2023."
403,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Background,,"Since 2020, Republicans have advocated for investigations into the business dealings of Joe Biden's son, Hunter, who they alleged engaged in influence-peddling. They have sought to directly connect Hunter's financial affairs to Joe, and demonstrate that Joe benefited from Hunter's business dealings. A specific allegation that Joe sought to protect Hunter from a corruption investigation by arranging to have the Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin fired has been repeatedly shown to be false. They have also accused the Department of Justice of interfering in a federal investigation into Hunter, which has been ongoing since 2018, to grant him preferential treatment. To that end, congressional Republicans have launched multiple committee investigations to look into these allegations, including the House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family. By the time of the impeachment inquiry, these investigations had not produced evidence of wrongdoing by the president. Over the course of the committee investigations, McCarthy alleged that the Biden administration engaged in ""obstruction,"" although Oversight Committee chair James Comer said on Fox Business on June 29, 2023, that for every subpoena he had issued during his investigation, ""we've gotten 100 percent of what we requested, whether it's with the FBI or with banks or with Treasury.""Former president Donald Trump, as well as several Republican members of the House of Representatives and Senate, have expressed a desire to retaliate against the impeachments of Trump by impeaching Biden. Following Joe Biden's inauguration, various Republican members of Congress have engaged in several efforts to impeach him. The first of these articles of impeachment was filed one day after Biden's inauguration by Marjorie Taylor Greene, citing the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory. In the 118th Congress, Republicans were able to hold a majority in the House of Representatives, comprising several members of the Freedom Caucus. Kevin McCarthy, leader of the House Republican Conference, was elected speaker of the House after several days and many votes as opposition—primarily led by members of the Freedom Caucus—mounted against him; as part of negotiations, McCarthy conceded to his opponents and faced pressure from Republican members to either impeach Biden or launch an impeachment inquiry against him. The Fiscal Responsibility Act, an act drafted to resolve the 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis, weakened McCarthy's standing with members of the Freedom Caucus who opposed his negotiations with Biden.In June 2023, the House of Representatives voted to begin an investigation into Biden's removal and referred two impeachment articles written by Lauren Boebert to committee. McCarthy privately told his members that he would consider impeachment if the Oversight Committee investigation produced sufficient evidence. Trump has privately and publicly encouraged impeaching Biden. On Truth Social, he lambasted Democrats for impeaching him amid the Trump–Ukraine scandal. Leading up to the inquiry, Trump met with House Republican Conference chair Elise Stefanik and Greene, discussing impeaching Biden both times. In September, McCarthy promised in an interview with Breitbart News that he would only open an impeachment inquiry into Biden with a full house vote."
404,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Initiation of the inquiry,,"On September 12, 2023, Kevin McCarthy directed three House committees—the Judiciary Committee, chaired by Jim Jordan, the Oversight Committee, chaired by Comer, and the Ways and Means Committee, chaired by Jason Smith—to hold a formal impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden. McCarthy did not hold a floor vote on the impeachment inquiry and he did not appear to have sufficient Republican support to pass a floor vote. The chairmen of all three committees had been involved in preceding investigations into the Biden family. McCarthy asked Comer to lead the inquiry. When announcing the inquiry, McCarthy claimed that earlier findings of House investigations ""paint a picture of corruption"" involving Biden and his relatives, particularly regarding the business dealings of Hunter.McCarthy alleged that Joe Biden used his official office as vice president to coordinate with Hunter's business contacts and noted that Joe Biden was aware of Hunter's business dealings. He also brought up allegations that Joe Biden benefitted from Hunter's foreign business dealings. McCarthy argued that the Oversight Committee investigation demonstrated and warranted further investigation by the House of Representatives and that an impeachment inquiry would allow for a stronger investigation. McCarthy concluded the allegations by claiming that Biden's family was given ""special treatment"" by the Biden administration despite these ""serious allegations.""According to McCarthy, the impeachment inquiry would give House Republicans ""the full power to gather all the facts and answers for the American public"". Traditionally, congressional committees are given more sweeping authority to issue and enforce subpoenas when done so as part of an impeachment inquiry. McCarthy has drawn parallels between the Biden and Nixon administrations, accusing the Biden administration of using ""government much like Richard Nixon by denying us to get the information that we need"".Despite claiming that he would hold a vote, McCarthy opened the inquiry independently. McCarthy has defended this reversal, saying that then-speaker Nancy Pelosi ""changed the precedent"" in launching an impeachment inquiry into Trump in 2019, when Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry a month before a floor vote was eventually held to approve it. During the 2019 impeachment inquiry against Trump, McCarthy had asserted that he believed that an authorizing vote must be held in order for there to be a legitimate impeachment inquiry."
405,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,House committee investigations,,"The House Oversight Committee plans to focus on the Biden family and their finances, the House Judiciary Committee on alleged coverups, and the House Ways and Means Committee on tax sensitive information.Comer said that House Oversight investigators would seek additional emails dating back to the Obama administration and witness testimony from people alleging misconduct by the Biden family. The Oversight Committee also plans to pursue bank records for Hunter and James Biden, Joe Biden's brother. The Oversight Committee's ranking member, Jamie Raskin, has referred to the GOP investigation as a ""complete and total bust."" The House Oversight Committee officially held its first hearing on September 28.Jordan said that the House Judiciary Committee planned to subpoena lawyers in the Justice Department's tax division who worked on the Weiss special counsel investigation into Hunter, headed by David Weiss. The ranking member, Jerrold Nadler, called the impeachment inquiry ""absurd,"" and said that it was ""poisoning our vital oversight work.""The Comer committee issued a subpoena for Hunter's bank records on September 25, finding he received two wire transfers from Chinese nationals in summer 2019 that listed his father's Delaware home as the beneficiary address. Comer said in a statement, ""Joe Biden's abuse of public office for his family's financial gain threatens our national security. What did the Bidens do with this money from Beijing?"" Hunter's attorney Abbe Lowell asserted the wires were loans from a Chinese company in which Biden had invested in 2017, and he used his equity in the investment as security for the loans. Lowell said the money went into ""his new bank account which listed the address on his driver's license, his parents' address, because it was his only permanent address at the time.""Smith held a press conference on September 27 to discuss allegations of Biden influence peddling and a two-tiered justice system. Smith alleged that Hunter sent a WhatsApp message in June 2017, telling a business associate that he said he was not willing to ""sign over my family's brand."" Smith said it was clear that Hunter was referring to ""Vice President Joe Biden's political power and influence."" Joe's term as vice president had ended months earlier, but Smith said Biden was a presidential candidate at that time; Joe announced his candidacy in April 2019. Smith also discussed an email from a Weiss deputy telling investigators to remove all references to Joe Biden as ""political figure one"" from a search warrant for Hunter. When a reporter mentioned the email was sent in August 2020, when Trump was president, Smith suggested that was inconsequential to the underlying allegation of a two-tiered justice system. When pressed on the timelines of his comments, Smith said he was ""not an expert on the timeline"" but would like the Bidens to ""tell us about all the timelines.""On September 28, the House Oversight Committee held the first hearing of the inquiry. Comer said in his opening statement that investigators had ""uncovered a mountain of evidence"" and alleged Biden used his official government role for his family's gain, but committee members did not present clear evidence to support the allegation. Three expert witnesses called by committee Republicans testified there was not impeachable evidence against Biden at that point. Committee Republicans made several false or misleading statements during the hearing. Nancy Mace falsely stated, ""We already know the president took bribes from Burisma."" Jim Jordan falsely said Hunter had acknowledged he was unqualified to sit on the Burisma board, though Biden had said ""I was completely qualified to be on the board"" in a 2019 interview, but added he probably would not have been hired if not for his surname. Jordan also misled by suggesting the Justice Department improperly blocked investigators from examining Joe Biden. A Trump-era Justice Department prosecutor had directed that references to Joe Biden be removed from a search warrant for Hunter, explaining there was no legal basis to reference Joe Biden in the warrant. Byron Donalds presented a text message from James Biden to suggest that his brother Joe Biden would help in Hunter's business matters, though preceding texts showed the discussion related to the younger Biden's alimony payments and other personal expenses. Pat Fallon asserted ""Hunter admitted that he talked to his dad about business, specifically Burisma,"" referencing a 2019 New Yorker interview. In 2015, an Obama administration special envoy to Ukraine raised the issue of Hunter sitting on the Burisma board with the vice president. Hunter recounted in that 2019 interview that ""Dad said, 'I hope you know what you're doing,' and I said, 'I do'"".While McCarthy was ousted as speaker on October 3, McCarthy's successor Mike Johnson (elected on October 25) confirmed in an October 27 Fox News interview with Sean Hannity that the inquiry will continue. The previous month, Johnson had previously expressed support for the impeachment inquiry after it was announced, claiming then that he believed there to already be enough justification to impeach Biden. However, in his October 27 Fox News interview, Johnson took a different tone on his current judgement of guilt, claiming, ""we've not predetermined the outcome of this. We've not prejudged it.""On November 6, 2023, Comer stated that the Oversight committee would subpoena James and Hunter for testimony.On November 7, 2023, Weiss testified before the House Judiciary Committee, the first time a special counsel had testified before Congress during a probe. Weiss stated that he was the ""decision-maker"" in his investigation of Hunter, and that ""other United States Attorneys, the Tax Division or anyone else at the Department of Justice"" had not interfered in the case."
406,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Responses,Republican response,"Comer and Jordan expressed support for the impeachment inquiry's potential to provide them with expanded investigative powers, with Jordan saying that it would ramp up ""the pace at which we're going to try to get information from the executive branch"", as courts may provide more support for investigators' demands for information. Jordan has also said that a vote on the inquiry would be helpful in giving weight to the significance of the impeachment inquiry.At the time it was announced, there was a divide among Republican congressmen in their attitudes toward the inquiry. After the inquiry was announced, multiple Republican members of Congress expressed support for the inquiry, indicating that they believed there to be substantial enough grounds to launch one. This included House members Mike Garcia, Nick LaLota, Tony Gonzales, and Senators John Cornyn and Mike Lee. Some Republican members of Congress who had previously publicly urged against launching an inquiry adopted a pro-inquiry stance following the inquiry's initiation. Many Republicans in the more electorally competitive swing districts of the House of Representatives voiced support for the launch of the inquiry. Contrarily, multiple Republican members of Congress voiced concerns after the launch of the inquiry. A number, including House members Ken Buck,  Dave Joyce, Don Bacon, and Senator Shelley Capito, commented that they had not seen evidence to warrant an impeachment inquiry. In a Washington Post opinion piece, Buck—a member of the deeply conservative House Freedom Caucus—wrote that his fellow House Republicans ""who are itching for an impeachment are relying on an imagined history,"" specifically refuting their allegations that Biden acted improperly regarding the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin. However, some members who have raised concerns about the lack of available evidence still support holding an impeachment inquiry in order to allow for a complete evidentiary record, including House members Dusty Johnson and French Hill and Senator Mitt Romney. Other Republican members of Congress, such as House members Brian Fitzpatrick, George Santos, Senators Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, and Marco Rubio, have expressed concerns about ""cheapening"" and lowering the bar for impeachment. Matt Gaetz referred to the impeachment inquiry as ""failure theatre"".Trump said that the impeachment inquiry was potentially motivated by revenge on his behalf, stating that if he hadn't been impeached, ""perhaps you wouldn't have it being done to them"".Freedom Caucus members Matt Gaetz and Matt Rosendale denounced the impeachment effort as a political stunt in September. During an invitation-only video conference, Gaetz said, ""I don't believe that we are endeavoring upon a legitimate impeachment of Joe Biden ... I think it's for the sake of having another bad thing to say about Joe Biden."""
407,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Responses,Democratic response,"Biden responded to the impeachment inquiry by stating, ""Well, I tell you what, I don't know quite why, but they just knew they wanted to impeach me. And now, the best I can tell, they want to impeach me because they want to shut down the government"". He then stated that he was not focused on impeachment and said, ""I've got to deal with the issues that affect the American people every single solitary day"". The White House also sent a memo to U.S. news organizations, calling on them to ""scrutinize House Republicans' demonstrably false claims"" and disputing allegations of misconduct.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries vowed to defend Biden ""until the very end"" and compared the impeachment inquiry to a kangaroo court.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized McCarthy for bowing to conservative pressure and labeled the impeachment inquiry as a witch hunt."
408,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Responses,Response by academics,"At the launch of the impeachment inquiry, both University of Missouri School of Law professor emeritus Frank Bowman, Columbia Law School professor Philip Bobbitt (both of who have authored texts on impeachment), as well as University of North Carolina School of Law professor and constitutional law expert Michael Gerhardt commented that they had not seen anything they would consider to be evidence against Biden. They all consider this inquiry to be a departure from past presidential impeachment inquiries, which they say were preceded by significant evidence of wrongdoing by the president. Both Bowman and Bobbitt expressed concern that the inquiry will cheapen the concept of impeachment, thereby damaging the federal government's checks and balances. Calling the impeachment inquiry ""absolutely shocking,"" Bowman remarked that the Republicans behind the impeachment effort, ""have no interest at all in preserving the basic integrity of the process, or indeed their own power as legislators in legitimate opposition and tension with the executive branch."" Gerhardt called the launch of an inquiry ""an outcome in search of a process."" Gerhardt would later be called by Democrats as an expert witness during the opening hearing of the inquiry.Upon the launch of the inquiry, George Washington University Law School professor and constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley said ""the suggestion that [existing evidence] does not meet the standard for an inquiry into impeachable offenses is an example of willful blindness"". Turley was later called on by Republican members of Congress to testify as a witness during the first impeachment inquiry hearing, where he also stated that Congress had failed to connect Hunter's alleged influence peddling to President Biden. He also stated that some of the details they had gathered ""really do gravitate in favor of the president"". Turley had previously been a witness during the 2019 impeachment inquiry against Trump, having been called to provide expert testimony on behalf of Trump's defense, as well as a witness in the impeachment of Bill Clinton, testifying in favor of impeaching Clinton."
409,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Analysis,Legal standing,"The House of Representatives is not legally obligated to start an impeachment inquiry with a vote on the House floor, as it is not required under either the Constitution or House rules. However, the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice ruled in January 2020 that impeachment inquiries are valid only if authorized by the full House, following the impromptu impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. The opinion remains binding on the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, as all are part of the executive branch. It also binds future presidential administrations unless revoked or superseded. The opinion finds that without a floor vote, subpoenas issued by House committees would lack the weight normally granted when pertaining to an impeachment inquiry."

413,Hurricane Jova (2023),Summary,,"Hurricane Jova was a powerful Category 5 hurricane, the first Pacific hurricane to reach Category 5 strength since Willa in 2018, as well as one of the fastest intensifying tropical cyclones on record in the Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone basin. Jova was the tenth named storm, seventh hurricane, fifth major hurricane and first Category 5 hurricane of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season.
Jova originated from a tropical wave that entered the Pacific Ocean on September 1. The system briskly organized and became a tropical depression the following day. After brief inhibition by wind shear, Jova explosively organized over the next two days. It formed a prominent central dense overcast on September 5 and nascent eye feature, signaling its intensification into a hurricane. In a 24-hour period ending early on September 7, Jova's maximum sustained winds increased by 90 mph (150 km/h) to its peak of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 929 mbar (hPa; 27.43 inHg). This made it a Category 5 hurricane and was one of the five-fastest periods of intensification on record in the basin. Thereafter, an eyewall replacement cycle and decreasing sea surface temperatures caused the storm to steadily weaken. It fell below major hurricane status on September 8 and further weakened to a tropical storm on September 9. The total collapse of convection on September 10 marked its degeneration into a remnant low. The system later dissipated on September 12 as it opened up into a trough.
Jova's expansive cloud shield led to some rainfall in western states of Mexico with minor flooding occurring in Baja California Sur. Large waves and rip currents affected coastal areas from Sinaloa northward to the San Francisco Bay Area in California."
414,Hurricane Jova (2023),Meteorological history,,"On August 31, 2023, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began forecasting the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis off the southwest coast of Mexico. The following day, a tropical wave crossed into the Pacific Ocean near El Salvador. Environmental conditions favored development and the NHC assessed a high likelihood of the system becoming a tropical cyclone within seven days. Convective activity began organizing on September 3 as a broad area of low pressure coalesced. On September 4, the system developed a well-defined surface circulation accompanied by a prominent banding feature to its west. Based on the improved organization, the NHC assessed the formation of Tropical Depression Eleven-E at 21:00 UTC. The environment ahead of the cyclone proved exceptionally conducive to rapid intensification with ample low-level moisture, low wind shear, and high sea surface temperatures. A deep-layer ridge anchored over northern Mexico steered the depression on a west to west-northwest course and would remain the dominant steering factor throughout the cyclone's duration. While initially hampered by moderate wind shear early on September 5, strengthening began later that day as upper-level outflow improved and deep convection blossomed over the system's center. Concurrent with the improved structure, the NHC estimated the system to have reached tropical storm intensity at 09:00 UTC, and the storm received the name Jova.
Rapid intensification ensued later on September 5 as a central dense overcast developed with tops reaching −112 °F (−80 °C). Imagery from the GPM Microwave Imager depicted the beginnings of a mid-level eyewall. This trend continued into September 6 as cloud tops deepened to −130 °F (−90 °C) and Jova's eye became more defined on infrared and visible satellite imagery. Following this, the NHC upgraded Jova to a hurricane at 09:00 UTC. Dramatic intensification continued throughout September 6 into the early hours of September 7. A well-defined 12 mi (19 km) wide pinhole eye formed within a symmetrical convective mass. Extensive lightning was detected within the eyewall by the GOES-16 Geostationary Lightning Mapper. Jova's intensification culminated at 03:00 UTC when it reached Category 5 hurricane status. Jova's maximum sustained winds peaked at 160 mph (260 km/h) and its central pressure fell to 929 mbar (hPa; 27.43 inHg). Within a 24-hour period Jova's winds increased by 90 mph (150 km/h), ranking it among the top six fastest intensification episodes in the Eastern Pacific basin on record.Upon reaching its peak on September 7, Jova began an eyewall replacement cycle (ERC) whereby its small eye was replaced by a larger one. Its convective structure became less symmetric as convective bursts occurred along the south side of its center and overall cloud tops warmed. By the latter half of the day weakening ensued with the hurricane's inner core collapsing as the ERC progressed and its eye becoming obscured by clouds. The hurricane's structure steadily degraded with the inner and outer cores fragmenting as dry air was pulled into the circulation. Jova weakened below major hurricane status by 09:00 UTC on September 8. Later that day, Jova crossed a sharp sea surface temperature gradient, with temperatures ahead of the hurricane dropping substantially. Banding features surrounding the hurricane began breaking apart at this time. Early on September 9, Jova's eye completely disappeared and deep convection became limited to the western half of the storm, soon after, the system was downgraded to a tropical storm. Jova's movement shifted northwest as it reached the edge of the ridge that had been steering it west-northwest. Throughout September 9 convection pulsated as Jova's weakening trend briefly reprieved, however, the storm's convection continued its collapse on September 10 as Jova traversed 23 °C (73 °F) waters. With the complete loss of convective activity later that day, Jova degenerated into a remnant low by 21:00 UTC marking the cessation of it being a tropical cyclone. The remnants of Jova turned west-southwest and dissipated as it opened up into a trough on September 12."
415,Hurricane Jova (2023),Preparations and impact,Mexico,"Mexico's Servicio Meteorológico Nacional warned of heavy rains in Baja California Sur, Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, and Sinaloa stemming from Jova's immense cloud shield. Waves of 6.6–13.1 ft (2–4 m) were expected along the coasts of Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit and Sinaloa. Four beaches in Los Cabos closed due to dangerous conditions. Heavy rains in Baja California Sur swelled small streams, flooded roads, and caused some vehicles to become stranded."
416,Hurricane Jova (2023),Preparations and impact,Southwestern United States,"Moisture associated with Jova was pulled into the Southwestern United States by upper-level southwesterly flow, reaching California on September 10. This led to increased humidity in coastal areas. Minimal rainfall was recorded that day in the mountains of southern California. While Doppler weather radar returns showed rain in the region, dryer low- to mid-level air evaporated rainfall and led to virga. Waves of 5–8 ft (1.5–2.4 m) and rip currents were forecast for south-facing beaches in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties as well as the Channel Islands. This prompted a high surf advisory for the region. The San Francisco Bay Area farther north faced similar risks with rip currents and breaking waves up to 8 ft (2.4 m). Five people were rescued in Ocean Beach, San Francisco, after being pulled to sea by rip currents on September 10."

420,List of United States tornadoes from September to November 2023,Summary,,"This page documents all tornadoes confirmed by various weather forecast offices of the National Weather Service in the United States in September, October and November 2023. Tornado counts are considered preliminary until final publication in the database of the National Centers for Environmental Information. On average, there are 66 confirmed tornadoes in the United States in September, 59 in October and 54 in November.In September, tornadoes are most likely to occur in relation to the Atlantic hurricane season (as September is the peak month of hurricane season), and they can occur almost anywhere in the southern and eastern states as a result of landfalling tropical cyclones should such occur. A secondary focal point lies in the Midwest and Great Lakes as a result of early-autumn frontal systems. While tropical activity tends to decrease in October, the relative peak shifts into the Great Plains and towards the southern states as the jet stream shifts southward (albeit generally with less activity than in the spring months in the same regions). In November, these tornadoes are most likely in the southern states, closest to the warm Gulf of Mexico moisture, with occasional incursions farther north into the Midwest.With relatively quiet tropical activity in the United States in September and few early-season frontal systems, tornadic activity in September was almost non-existent, with only very isolated, weak tornado touchdowns. Only 10 tornadoes were confirmed, making it the least active September since 2009. October also saw well below normal activity with a total of 25 tornadoes, however more significant tornadoes occurred compared to the previous year."

451,September 2023 New York floods,Summary,,"On September 29, 2023, heavy rainfall led to flooding across portions of the New York metropolitan area and areas in New York City, United States. New York governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency for five boroughs in New York, including portions of Hudson Valley and Long Island, and New York City mayor Eric Adams declared a state of emergency for the city. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency for all 21 counties in the state, and Hoboken, New Jersey mayor Ravinder Bhalla also declared a state of emergency. 
The flooding suspended train service across numerous lines in Brooklyn, and every line on the New York City Subway was affected. Metro-North Railroad service was suspended on three lines, and several boroughs and numerous streets were flooded throughout the region. A ground stop was imposed on LaGuardia Airport, where nearly 60 flights were cancelled. The heavy rainfall was caused by a stalled low-pressure area as showers and thunderstorms developed on September 29."
452,September 2023 New York floods,Meteorological synopsis,,"A moderate risk of excessive rainfall was issued by the Weather Prediction Center, and a flood watch was issued for portions of New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey. A weak low-pressure area developed off the East Coast of the United States, absorbed the remains of Tropical Storm Ophelia, then stalled, dropping heavy rainfall across areas that were already under a flood watch after Ophelia had moved through the same region days earlier. Convection developed on the morning of September 29 after an upper-level trough approached from the Ohio valley and interacted with a strengthening cold front offshore in the Atlantic Ocean.Widespread heavy rainfall occurred in a concentrated area from the New York metropolitan area to southern New York to southern Connecticut to western Massachusetts along a low-level convergence axis. Favorable precipitable water values around 1.6 inches, elevated convective instability, and southeasterly low-level winds between 20-30 knots supported several rounds of heavy rain across the concentrated area. The mesoscale low-pressure area then moved east on the afternoon of September 29, where the convergence axis and elevated instability again produced heavy rainfall across Long Island, and weak instability values in the hundreds and moisture transport also contributed to rainfall rates of 1–2 inches (25–51 mm) per hour across southern Connecticut and western Massachusetts."
453,September 2023 New York floods,Impact,,"The National Weather Service in New York City issued a considerable flash flood warning for Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens as more than 4 inches (100 mm) of rain fell throughout the region. Flood warnings also covered more than 18 million people across the New York metropolitan area.New York governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency for five boroughs in New York, including boroughs in Hudson Valley and Long Island, and New York City mayor Eric Adams declared a state of emergency for the city. The New York Army National Guard was deployed. Several highways, including portions of FDR Drive, Hutchinson River Parkway, Major Deegan Expressway (I-87), Cross Island Parkway and Grand Central Parkway, were closed. Traffic was stopped on the Prospect Expressway (NY 27) near Kensington as vehicles were inundated by floodwaters.Every line on the New York City Subway was affected, with four routes completely suspended, 12 partially suspended, and an additional eight services significantly delayed, which included no train service on the 2, 3, 4, 5 routes in Brooklyn, and no service on the B and G routes at all. Metro-North Railroad service was suspended on the New Haven, Hudson and Harlem lines, and a terminal at LaGuardia Airport was shut down due to flooding. A ground stop was also imposed at the airport. Departures were delayed at John F. Kennedy International Airport due to heavy rainfall, with total rainfall of 8.67 inches (220 mm). Of that total, 8.05 inches (204 mm) of rain fell there on just September 29, setting the preliminary record for the highest rainfall in one day. NYC Ferry and Amtrak service was also delayed.Minor roof collapses and flooded basements occurred across the region. Sewers and roads were overwhelmed by flooding in Hoboken, New Jersey, and the mayor of Hoboken, Ravinder Bhalla, declared a state of emergency. Later, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency for all 21 counties in the state and ordered all state offices to close. A Major League Baseball game between the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies at Citi Field in Queens was postponed, and a separate Mets game against the Miami Marlins was suspended in the ninth inning due to rain. That game was later declared a Mets victory. A National Hockey League preseason game between the New York Rangers and New York Islanders at UBS Arena was postponed. Schools across the Bronxville Union Free School District were let out early due to the heavy rainfall that fell across portions of Bronxville and Westchester County, and an elementary school in Brooklyn was evacuated due to a boiler smoking possibly related to the flooding. More than 150 schools across New York were inundated by floodwaters, and more than 105 school buses were delayed, which affected more than 250 schools. Alamo Drafthouse in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island were closed indefinitely. Several attractions were closed, including Wildlife Conservation Society zoos; a female sea lion also briefly escaped from its enclosure in the Central Park Zoo. Electrical damage caused by the heavy rains forced an evacuation and temporary closure of Woodhull Medical Center. 28 people were rescued from floodwaters.Numerous locations across received more than 4 inches (100 mm) of rain, with Central Park recording 5.80 inches (147 mm) of rainfall, Midtown Manhattan recording 6.09 inches (155 mm) of rain, Fordham recording 6.19 inches (157 mm) of rain and Howard Beach recording 7.86 inches (200 mm) of rain.  The heaviest rainfall, however, was in Brooklyn where Park Slope received 9.80 inches (249 mm) of rain, with Valley Stream  in Nassau County recording 9.06 inches (230 mm) of rain. Parts of Brooklyn received 4.5 in (110 mm) of rain in just three hours.Nearly 300 flights were cancelled and 400 were delayed at LaGuardia Airport, while 200 flights were cancelled and more than 400 were delayed at John F. Kennedy International Airport."
454,September 2023 New York floods,Possible link between excessive rainfall and climate change,,"According to The Independent, ""flooding is blamed on climate change"". Reuters states that extreme weather events are becoming ""a new normal"".The commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, Rohit Aggarwala, drew a relationship between the 2023 floods and climate change, linking the floods with previous weather events. Aggarwala stated, ""This changing weather pattern is the result of climate change, and the sad reality is our climate is changing faster than our infrastructure can respond.""Daniel A. Zarrilli, a special adviser to Columbia University on the institution's climate and sustainability practices, warns that, ""That storm with the scenes of water rushing over roads and sidewalks were similar to those in 2021 when Hurricane Ida inundated the city and left 11 people dead in Queens."" He indicates that the 2021 hurricane was a warning sign of further weather events to come.Ryan Maue, the former chief scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, quoted Tommaso Alberti, a researcher at Italy’s Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia saying, ""that the extreme event that hit New York 'aligns with climate change projections'"". He added that while natural variability can deliver major storms, 'human-driven climate change is the primary driver, underscoring the urgent need for climate mitigation and adaptation efforts'."
455,NXT No Mercy,Summary,,"NXT No Mercy was the 14th No Mercy professional wrestling supercard produced by WWE. It primarily featured wrestlers from the promotion's NXT brand division. The event took place on Saturday, September 30, 2023, and was livestreamed from the Mechanics Bank Arena in Bakersfield, California. This was the first No Mercy event held since 2017, the first to livestream on Peacock, the first to be held on a Saturday, and the first to not be available on traditional pay-per-view.
This was WWE's first livestreaming event in which the company was not owned and controlled by the McMahon family, as the company's sale to Endeavor was finalized on September 12, 2023, with WWE and Ultimate Fighting Championship merging to become divisions of a new entity called TKO Group Holdings. NXT No Mercy in turn marked WWE's first livestreaming event under TKO.
Seven matches were contested at the event, including one on the pre-show. In the main event, Raw's Becky Lynch defeated Tiffany Stratton in an Extreme Rules match to retain the NXT Women's Championship. In another prominent match, Ilja Dragunov defeated Carmelo Hayes to win the NXT Championship."
456,NXT No Mercy,Production,Background,"No Mercy was first held by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE as a United Kingdom-exclusive pay-per-view (PPV) in May 1999. A second No Mercy was then held later that same year in October, but in the United States, which established No Mercy as the annual October PPV for the promotion until 2008. No Mercy was discontinued in 2009, but it was reinstated in October 2016 following the reintroduction of the brand extension, which brought back brand-exclusive PPVs. Following WrestleMania 34 in April 2018, however, No Mercy was discontinued as WWE ended brand-exclusive PPVs, resulting in the reduction of yearly PPVs produced.On July 27, 2023, WWE announced the return of No Mercy for their developmental brand, NXT. The 14th No Mercy was scheduled to take place on Saturday, September 30 at the Mechanics Bank Arena in Bakersfield, California, marking the first No Mercy to be held on a Saturday. In addition to the WWE Network in most international markets, it was the first No Mercy to livestream on Peacock after the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March 2021. It was subsequently the first No Mercy to not air on traditional PPV as NXT events ceased airing on PPV beginning in 2022.From January 2023, there had been speculation that WWE had been placed up for sale. Hours before WrestleMania 39 Night 2 began, CNBC reported via multiple sources that a deal between WWE and Endeavor, the parent company of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) via Zuffa, was imminent. The deal involved a merger of WWE with the UFC into a new publicly traded company, with Endeavor holding a 51% stake. The sale was confirmed the next day on April 3, 2023, and was finalized on September 12, with WWE merging with the UFC to become divisions of TKO Group Holdings. NXT No Mercy was in turn WWE's first livestreaming event held in which the company was not owned and controlled by the McMahon family, and subsequently the first livestreaming event under TKO."
457,NXT No Mercy,Production,Storylines,"The card included seven matches that were the result of scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the NXT brand, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television program, NXT, and the supplementary online streaming show, Level Up.
At NXT: Heatwave, during a celebration with Meta-Four backstage after Noam Dar won the NXT Heritage Cup, Dar received a letter from the Heritage Cup Committee. The letter stated that on the next episode, a global number one contender's tournament would start, and Dar would defend the Heritage Cup against the winner at No Mercy. On August 23 during WWE The Bump, the rules of the ""NXT Global Heritage Invitational"" were explained. The tournament would be a round-robin style tournament featuring two groups with four wrestlers in each group. Matches would have a 12-minute time limit, and victories would earn a wrestler two points, while a 12-minute draw earned both wrestlers one point. The winner of Group A would then face the winner of Group B on the September 26 episode of NXT to determine the number one contender. On August 24, the first two participants were revealed as Tyler Bate in Group A and Joe Coffey in Group B. Two days later, four more contestants were announced: Butch and Charlie Dempsey for Group A  and Duke Hudson and Nathan Frazer for Group B. The next day, the last two contestants were announced as Axiom in Group A and Akira Tozawa in Group B.

A match between Ali and Lee, with Mysterio serving as the special guest referee, was scheduled for the following week with the winner facing Mysterio for the title at No Mercy, which was won by Ali after a fast count by Mysterio. On September 21, however, Ali was among the wrestlers who were released from their WWE contracts. On September 26, Shawn Michaels announced on X that a triple threat match would be held on that night's episode of NXT between Lee, Axiom, and Tyler Bate to determine who would instead challenge Mysterio for the title at No Mercy.

464,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Summary,,"From July 14 to November 9, 2023, the American actors' union SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) was on strike over a labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).  As the longest strike in SAG-AFTRA history, its combined impact with the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike resulted in the loss of 45,000 jobs, and ""an estimated $6.5 billion"" loss to the economy of Southern California. According to Deadline Hollywood, the ""harshest pain"" was ""perhaps felt among the below-the-line workers who've had to sell or mortgage their homes, and wipe through IRAs to survive.""Along with the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike (which ended on September 27, 2023), it was part of a series of broader Hollywood labor disputes. Both the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes contributed to the biggest interruption to the American film and television industries since the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 just three years prior. In addition to standing in solidarity with the writers, the strike was led by changes in the industry caused by streaming and its effect on residuals, as well as other new technologies like AI and digital recreation. It marked the first time that actors initiated a labor dispute in the U.S. since the 1980 actors strike and the first time that actors and writers have walked out simultaneously since 1960.
Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP took place from October 2 to October 11, and resumed on October 24. On November 8, 2023, a tentative deal between the two sides was reached. Striking ended on November 9 at 12:01 a.m. PST."
465,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Background,Unionization in Hollywood,"The Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) is a labor union that represents approximately 160,000 media professionals and entertainers. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) trade association represents film and television studios in collective bargaining negotiations with unions such as SAG-AFTRA, the Directors Guild of America (DGA), and Writers Guild of America, East and Writers Guild of America West, comprising the Writers Guild of America (WGA). SAG-AFTRA was formed by the merger of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) in March 2012, allowing SAG-AFTRA to represent not only actors, but also journalists, talk show hosts, and other broadcast workers. The WGA and the Screen Actors Guild have not simultaneously been on strike since 1960, when actors joined striking writers over residual payments from films sold to television networks. The 1980 actors strike involved the combined efforts of SAG and AFTRA. The largest SAG-AFTRA strike since 1980 occurred in 2000, in which commercial actors went on strike to push for a continuation of the residual system against advertiser backlash, amidst the divisions between SAG and AFTRA.During the last decade and the rise of streaming, writers and actors have been frustrated over studio policy regarding residuals from streaming services; the decline of network television has led to a stronger reliance on other residuals. The 2007–08 WGA strike was motivated in large part by studio executives insisting that writers should receive no residuals from streaming services. The 2007–08 strike cost the city of Los Angeles an estimated US$1.5 billion, according to NPR. As with striking WGA writers, actors have expressed concerns about the use of artificial intelligence, noting that it could be used to replicate their likeness without compensation."
466,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Background,Pre-strike activity,"Weeks after the Writers Guild of America went on strike in May 2023, SAG-AFTRA's national board of directors unanimously agreed to pursue a strike authorization vote ahead of a renewed contract; SAG-AFTRA approved a new contract in 2020 that would expire on June 30, 2023. The union stated that it did not intend to strike but that it sought to give its negotiators ""maximum bargaining leverage"" ahead of negotiations on June 7, 2023. SAG-AFTRA cited several issues in negotiations, including ""economic fairness, residuals, regulating the use of artificial intelligence and alleviating the burdens of the industry-wide shift to self-taping"", and told its members that the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers would cut actors' salaries to ""pad corporate profits"". In a video released on May 30, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jean Smart, and Kumail Nanjiani appealed to members to vote to strike but reserved that a vote for strike authorization was solely a bargaining tool, not a vote to order an immediate strike.On June 5, 2023, SAG-AFTRA approved the strike authorization by a 98% margin, according to the union. High-profile members—including Quinta Brunson, Jennifer Lawrence, and Rami Malek—signaled their willingness to strike ahead of the deadline to achieve a ""transformative deal"", despite ""extremely productive"" negotiations. SAG-AFTRA agreed to extend negotiations to midnight on July 13, 2023, in an attempt to avoid a strike, but negotiations broke down in July 2023. SAG-AFTRA surveyed members on a strike on July 5, 2023 and began preparing picket signs two days later.The AMPTP agreed to a ""last-minute request"" for mediation from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service on July 11, 2023; congressional and public affairs director Greg Raelson stated that a federal mediator would be present the following day. In turn, SAG-AFTRA accused the AMPTP of attempting to extend negotiations beyond the deadline and reiterated that it would not continue negotiating after July 12, 2023. A number of high-profile actors, including Lawrence and Malek, then affirmed their support again by signing a letter urging the union to take aggressive measures and stating their willingness to strike. It was later reported by Variety that mediation collapsed after AMPTP President Carol Lombardini insulted negotiators by telling them to ""be civilized"" and avert a strike, which prompted a walkout by union negotiators. In response to Lombardini's comment, SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher reportedly said to AMPTP negotiators ""Now you've got two unions on strike"" as they left.On July 12, a statement was made announcing the construction of a Fast & Furious-themed roller coaster; the date of the announcement coincided with the deadline SAG-AFTRA gave before ending negotiations with the AMPTP, and construction began by the strike's start. This added to the construction that began on May 8, shortly after the WGA began protesting on-site, obstructing Lankershim Boulevard along the west end of the park's campus and parking lot and further restricting sidewalk access. The sidewalks in front of Gates 1, 2, 4, and 5 would be scaffolded-off and demolished in this construction. Despite prior advice from the Los Angeles Police Department's Labor Relations Unit to place K-rails from River Road to Universal Hollywood Drive for the safety of protesters and other pedestrians since WGA protests as early as June 6, none were placed by July 18, by which time reports of two protesters being struck by vehicles had been made.
On July 13, with no agreement between SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee voted unanimously to recommend a strike to the union's national board. The national board held a vote officially approving the strike. SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher announced the strike would begin at midnight on July 14; the cast of Oppenheimer left the film's London premiere ahead of the announcement to walk out. Joined by chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Drescher asserted that the strike was a reluctant last resort and described the proposed contract as ""moving around furniture on the Titanic."" In the press conference, Crabtree-Ireland alleged that the AMPTP attempted to include a proposal that allowed studios to, for a one-time fee equivalent to one day's pay, have exclusive and indefinite rights to extras' likenesses, including the use of generative AI to replicate them on screen. Media commentators likened this to the film The Congress (2013) and the Black Mirror sixth series episode ""Joan Is Awful"" (2023). However, AMPTP denied these claims, stating that their proposal would allow usage of these replicas within the specific film for which they are employed, and that any other uses would require consent and further compensation."
467,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Jul-23,"The strike officially began on July 14. As part of the rules established on July 10, actors cannot engage in film or television productions and cannot take part in promotional work, such as press junkets, film premieres, and events—including San Diego Comic-Con, which was scheduled for July 20–23. The strike action does not apply to SAG-AFTRA members who work under contracts that are negotiated by the union separately from the AMPTP contract, including broadcast journalists. Work in podcasts, ""micro-budget"" independent films, and student films is allowed, as is ""unscripted"" television work such as game shows, reality competition shows, documentaries, and talk shows. Internationally, SAG-AFTRA members are authorized to continue work in the United Kingdom under pre-established Equity collective bargaining agreements, as UK law criminalizes solidarity strikes. The HBO series House of the Dragon thus continued its UK-based filming with SAG-AFTRA actors operating under Equity contracts, prompting backlash among fans of the series.On July 17, the Ficus trees on Barham Boulevard's sidewalk outside Gate 8 were pruned almost entirely of their leaves. Pine trees on the opposite side of Barham were not touched, nor were a row of pepper trees behind the fence near the production gate. The pruning was described as a vindictive action because the trees had been being used by protesters as shade from the over 90 °F (32 °C) summer temperatures of Southern California. The pruning was also described as illegal, on the grounds that the trees are owned by the city and that Los Angeles' tree ordinances prohibit trimming them between July and September. NBCUniversal issued a statement to Deadline Hollywood denying that the trimming was done out of malice, claiming that they trim the trees outside the park in July annually for safety, and describing it and the obstructive construction hazards as ""unintended challenges for demonstrators"". NBCUniversal was fined US$250 for violating tree laws and destroying city property.Also on July 17, SAG-AFTRA released a twelve-page statement outlining the breakdown in negotiations, and terms they found unacceptable, including but not limited to a five-percent salary increase for actors, while the union had asked for eleven percent. The AMPTP released a counter-statement, highlighting that its actions were being ""deliberately distort[ed]"" and that SAG-AFTRA had chosen to pass over ""the most lucrative deal we have ever negotiated... valued at $318 million over the three-year term of the contract.""On July 18, NBCUniversal was accused of conducting business at Universal Studios Hollywood to deter or endanger the protesters and infringe on their rights to protest. In response, SAG-AFTRA and WGA issued a joint grievance to the National Labor Relations Board against NBCUniversal, accusing the company of interfering with their freedom to picket and endangering their members. Writers Guild of America West additionally filed a petition to the AMPTP in response to NBCUniversal's failure to install barriers to protect WGA and SAG-AFTRA protestors from the risk of being forced into traffic. NBCUniversal responded to The Hollywood Reporter in a statement: ""We are aware of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA complaints. We strongly believe that the company has fulfilled our legal obligations under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and we will cooperate with respect to any inquiries by the National Labor Relations Board on this issue. While we understand the timing of our multi-year construction project has created challenges for demonstrators, we continue to work with public agencies to increase access. We support the unions' rights to demonstrate safely.""On July 19, 2023, SAG-AFTRA approved more films to be shot during the strike, including Ishana Night Shyamalan's The Watchers, Sam Raimi's Don't Move, and David Lowery's Mother Mary. 56 films then became eligible to shoot under strike rules.On July 25, 2023, thousands of actors rallied Tuesday morning at Times Square from 9:30 A.M. to noon to voice their concerns about fair treatment and wages. SAG-AFTRA's main contractual negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland spoke about the struggle that the union is facing with the AMPTP.  Many celebrities gave speeches to express their concerns about the future of their union and technological advancements in the industry.  In attendance were: Lauren Ambrose, Matt Bomer, Christine Baranski, Steve Buscemi, Bobby Cannavale, Tituss Burgess, Liza Colón-Zayas, Bryan Cranston, Jessica Chastain, Gregory Diaz, Jennifer Ehle, Brendan Fraser, Nancy Giles, Danai Gurira, Jill Hennessy, Marin Hinkle, Stephen Lang, Arian Moayed, Christopher Meloni, Chloë Grace Moretz, Wendell Pierce, Michael Shannon, Christian Slater, Corey Stoll, Merritt Wever and Rachel Zegler."

469,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Sep-23,"On September 1, the SAG-AFTRA National Board voted to send the video game strike authorization vote to its members, and on September 25, the results showed the authorization passed with 98.32% voting in favor.After the WGA and AMPTP reached a tentative agreement on September 24, leading to the official end of the WGA strike on September 27, SAG-AFTRA announced that it remains on strike, and called for renewed negotiations with the AMPTP. Later on September 27, SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP made a joint announcement that ""SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP will resume negotiations for a new TV/Theatrical contract on Monday, October 2."""
470,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Oct-23,"On October 2, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP met for negotiations, in the first meeting between the two unions since the SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14. Unlike the WGA's negotiations, the SAG-AFTRA's negotiations were held at SAG-AFTRA's headquarters on Wilshire Boulevard rather than the AMPTP's headquarters in Sherman Oaks as, according to Deadline, SAG-AFTRA officials were displeased ""with the AMPTP's setup"" and wanted a change of scenery. Participants included AMPTP chief Carol Lombardini, Donna Langley (NBCUniversal), David Zaslav (Warner Bros. Discovery), Ted Sarandos (Netflix), Bob Iger (Disney), as well as SAG-AFTRA's Fran Drescher, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, and Ray Rodriguez. The meeting concluded with an announcement that they would meet again on the 4th. This pattern continued from October 4 to 9, when a joint statement announced a meeting on October 11. However, negotiations broke down on October 11.Beginning October 12, numerous reasons were given as to why negotiations stopped. Sarandos said that talks broke down because SAG-AFTRA ""introduced a levy on subscribers on top of [other] areas"" which he said was ""a bridge too far."" However, SAG-AFTRA accused the AMPTP of using ""bully tactics"", with SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher, stating that the AMPTP ""had given us a proposal package. We worked for like 36 hours on it. We brought it back to them. We walked them through it and they left and then called a few hours later and said, 'We're breaking negotiations.'"" Drescher has also said that SAG-AFTRA wants to continue negotiations. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland (SAG-AFTRA) also responded stating that, ""the public statement from the CEOs in their press release from the AMPTP characterized our demands as excessive. But really we don't think they are. The numbers they've been using are wildly overstated.""On October 16, SAG-AFTRA announced that it will schedule negotiations regarding a new video game contract.On October 19, Deadline Hollywood reported that a Zoom call between Hollywood stars (George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson, Kerry Washington, Tyler Perry, Bradley Cooper, Meryl Streep, Jennifer Aniston, Robert De Niro, Ben Affleck, Laura Dern, Emma Stone, Reese Witherspoon, Ryan Reynolds, and Ariana DeBose) and SAG-AFTRA leaders introduced a proposal that ""amounts to the town's biggest earners defraying the costs to AMPTP signatories by eliminating the cap on membership dues, to be used to bolster health benefits and other areas that SAG-AFTRA is trying to shore up. The offer would remove the $1 million cap on membership dues,"" and ultimately would have brought $150 million over three years. While Crabtree-Ireland found the proposal ""worthy of review and consideration"" as ""someone wanting to help is not someone wanting to undermine,"" Drescher ultimately rejected the offer, saying that it is not feasible. She instead called upon the AMPTP to resume negotiations with SAG-AFTRA.On October 20, actress and former SAG president Melissa Gilbert dismissed a message from SAG-AFTRA stating that actors should not wear Halloween costumes of characters from ""struck companies,"" and said: ""THIS is what you guys come up with? Literally no one cares what anyone wears for Halloween ... do you really think this kind of infantile stuff is going to end the strike? ... please tell me you're going to make this rule go away... and go negotiate!... people are suffering mightily... this is the kind of silly bullshit that keeps us on strike.""On October 21, a joint statement announced that negotiations would resume on October 24, 2023. After a full day of negotiations on the 24th, the initial plan of meeting on October 25 was moved to October 26. Negotiations thus resumed on October 26, with Crabtree-Ireland stating that they are ""100% focused on making a fair deal at the table ... I am cautiously optimistic that can happen. I don't really want to characterize what's going on in the room but we're really focused on just staying prepared and focused on getting the negotiations done."" An individual also speculated to The Wrap that ""studios believe that if they can’t reach a deal in the next week with the Screen Actors Guild, which has been on strike since July 14, then no new production will be able to start before 2024."" After the meeting, they announced that negotiations will continue on October 27. Also on October 26, a public letter signed by thousands of high-profile actors was sent to the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee encouraging them to keep fighting for their values rather than cave in to the studios' demands, saying, ""As hard as this is, we would rather stay on strike than take a bad deal.""On October 27, 2023, negotiations continued, but no deal was made, and it was announced that talks will continue over the weekend. The four studio CEOs did not attend the meeting, and Lombardini attended in their stead. The meeting on October 28 was conducted virtually between SAG-AFTRA leaders Drescher, Crabtree-Ireland and the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee, with the guild awaiting a response from the studios, and plans to meet again on October 29.Then, after intermittent communications on October 29, a guild source told Deadline Hollywood that there ""is a feeling of optimism... looks like we're in the final stretch."" Deadline also states that ""both sides expressed confidence a deal may be reached within days, but as before cautioned the situation is still fluid. From our understanding, SAG-AFTRA and the studios have gained 'significant' traction on bridging their gap over what has been termed as success-based compensation for streaming shows and their casts."" Late in the evening SAG-AFTRA  stated: ""Both parties will be working independently Monday and re-engage on scheduling at the end of the day."" The next day, Crabtree-Ireland informed Deadline that the weekend talks were ""productive,"" and he continues to remain ""cautiously optimistic about making progress."" Also according to Deadline, he said that SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP are ""not just 'dotting I's and crossing T's' just yet... He added that AI is the current focus of talks."" Later in the afternoon a ""well-positioned individual"" told Deadline Hollywood that ""There's still a lot of work to be done."" Another source told Deadline, ""there's a lot of common ground now, and we are building on that... details still have to be determined, but we're heading in the right direction."" That evening, SAG-AFTRA released a statement saying they would meet again on October 31.On October 31, talks ended early out of consideration of families celebrating Halloween, with the intention to meet again on November 1, and with plans to have further meetings later in the week if needed."
471,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Nov-23,"Meetings continued from November 1 to November 3. On November 4, SAG-AFTRA lead negotiators stated that they ""received an offer today from the AMPTP, which they characterized as their 'Last, Best, and Final Offer' ... we are reviewing it and considering our response within the context of the critical issues addressed in our proposals."" On November 5, SAG-AFTRA sent a statement to its members saying that the negotiating team had ""analyzed and thoroughly discussed the AMPTP's counter proposal all day and well into the night and will continue our deliberations on Monday.""  On November 6, SAG-AFTRA sent a letter to members that said: ""This morning our negotiators formally responded to the AMPTP’s 'Last, Best & Final' offer ... there are several essential items on which we still do not have an agreement, including AI."" Later that evening, Deadline Hollywood reported that the virtual meeting ended late, with plans to continue negotiations. A studio insider told Deadline that, ""this was a productive session, some work still required before there’s a deal."" On November 7, SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP met again. A ""guild source"" told Deadline Hollywood that they ""are very close ... not done yet, but very close with strong protection language in place."" However, the meeting ended without a deal, and with plans to continue talking on November 8. In addition, Deadline Hollywood reported that it ""heard from several sources that guild president Fran Drescher was pinged by A-list stars asking about whether a deal was nigh."" Also on November 7, Tyler Perry gave an interview on CBS Mornings. While praising the SAG-AFTRA lead negotiators, he also stated that the work stoppage has been ""debilitating,"" and that ""it's really important to know when we've won. This is only a three-year deal. In two years, two-and-a-half years, we'll be renegotiating again ... so we have to know what have we won, and what have we won for now? That's the thing. For now. [...] If I had ran my business trying to get everything at once, I wouldn't be here. I've got as much as I can for now, so let's see what we can do next.""On November 8, 2023, SAG-AFTRA released a statement to its members that announced the end of the strike: “We are thrilled and proud to tell you that today your TV/Theatrical Negotiating Committee voted unanimously to approve a tentative agreement with the AMPTP. As of 12:01am on November 9, our strike is officially suspended and all picket locations are closed."" The SAG-AFTRA's National Board committee then approved the agreement by a majority of 86%. The summary of the agreement would be published on November 13, 2023. Voting among SAG-AFTRA members began on November 14 and is scheduled to conclude on December 5."

He predicted the strike would heavily affect HBO's 2024 season.Bob Iger, the CEO of The Walt Disney Company, said the actors' demands were ""not realistic"", adding they were ""adding to the set of challenges that this business is already facing"". Iger has been criticized for these remarks in light of his contract with Disney, which allows him to earn as much as $27 million in 2023 between his salary and bonuses. TheWrap wrote Iger makes over 500 times the median salary of Disney employees, while Town & Country wrote it was actually 1,242 times a Disney employee's median salary. When asked about Iger's remarks, Drescher described them as ""repugnant"" and ""tone deaf."" She went on to call Iger a ""land baron"" who ""has no idea about what is really happening"". The Wall Street Journal also called Iger ""tone deaf"". Actor Bryan Cranston responded to Iger in part: ""We will not be having our jobs taken away and given to robots."""

479,September 2023 northeastern U.S. floods,Summary,,"In a three-day period from September 11 to September 13, 2023, slow-moving thunderstorms associated with a low-pressure area caused flash flooding across multiple states across the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. A stationary front, combined with a convergence zone, caused significant flooding, prompting the National Weather Service to issue multiple flash flood warnings and two flash flood emergencies, one for the city of Leominster, Massachusetts, and the other for the Baltimore, Maryland, area. Several minor injuries occurred during the severe weather event, and hundreds of homes and vehicles were flooded. Evacuations also occurred after concerns of a compromised dam near a neighborhood of Leominster, and all schools in the city were closed the day after the floods. Massachusetts governor Maura Healey declared a state of emergency for Leominster and North Attleborough following the floods."

487,September 2023 southwestern U.S. floods,Summary,,"In a period of three days on September 1–3, 2023, flooding occurred as part of a seasonal monsoon season across portions of the Southwestern United States, including California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and the Las Vegas Valley. Muddy terrain during the Burning Man festival stranded more than 70,000 people."
488,September 2023 southwestern U.S. floods,Meteorological synopsis,,"Across the Desert Southwest, training showers and thunderstorms developed as they headed northward by an almost-undirectional flow, which was situated between a low-pressure area across California, and a retreating ridge of high pressure to the east of the low. Southerly flow between the low and the high pressure ridge caused moisture to be driven northward, surface-based convective available potential energy values of 1000–2000 j/kg yielded conditions for heavy rainfall-producing convective systems, and weak shortwaves combined with shear between 25–35 knots (29–40 mph; 46–65 km/h; 13–18 m/s) also provided thunderstorm development. On September 1, the Weather Prediction Center also stated in a mesoscale precipitation discussion that repeated rounds of thunderstorms were possible across the southwestern United States."

498,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Summary,,"The 2023 United Auto Workers strike was a labor strike involving automobile workers in the labor union United Auto Workers (UAW) and the three unionized automakers in the United States—Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Stellantis. These three automakers' factories combined employ about 145,000 UAW members and produce about 50 percent of the vehicles manufactured annually in the US, accounting for 1.5 percent of US GDP. The strike began on September 15, 2023, when the union was unable to reach a deal with the three automakers. It was the first trilateral strike against the three automakers in the union's history.
The hardline stance taken by the newly elected UAW president Shawn Fain contributed to the UAW's decision to strike. In particular, he has criticized stagnant wages that do not account for inflation and has called for the end of a tiered employment system that underpays newer employees, the restoration of overtime and retirement benefits that were lost as a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the institution of a four-day workweek, and improved worker protections against plant closures as electric vehicle production increases.
A central concern for the automakers is the cost of labor relative to domestic and foreign non-union competitors, particularly as the industry transitions to electric vehicle manufacturing. The automakers have stated that they anticipate the need to invest a significant portion of their profits from gasoline-powered vehicles into new production technology for electric vehicles.The strike was suspended in the last week of October as the automakers made tentative deals that largely matched the UAW demands, starting with Ford on October 25, followed by Stellantis on October 28 and finally General Motors on October 30. In announcing the deals with the automakers, UAW instructed workers to return to the job, thus ending the 46-day labor strike on October 30th. The new contracts would be ratified when individual UAW membership voting with all three companies ended from November 16-17 2023."
499,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Background,United Auto Workers,"The labor union United Auto Workers (UAW) represents approximately 145,000 automobile workers employed at Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Stellantis. To achieve its goals, UAW has engaged in strike action; from November 1945 to March 1946, UAW went on strike against General Motors. The 1945—1946 strike established a strategy, forged by then-UAW president Walter Reuther, to target efforts on a single company. Since the 1950s, UAW has faced declining union membership and a growing service sector, reducing the economic impact that a strike could have. In 2019, UAW autoworkers went on strike against General Motors. The 40-day work stoppage cost General Motors US$3.6 billion and caused a single-quarter recession in Michigan."
500,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Background,Contract negotiations,"In March 2023, newly elected UAW president Shawn Fain stated that workers were ""fed up with the status quo"" and assured that he would negotiate for changes to workers' contracts. Fain called for cost of living adjustments to account for inflation ahead of the current contracts expiring on September 14 and asked for wage increases lost in the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Members have expressed interest in both ending a two-tier wage system in which newer employees are paid significantly less than older employees, and domestic plant construction. Fain continued his sentiments at the Automotive Press Association in April, expressing disappointment in the idling of the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Belvidere, Illinois. Additionally, he lambasted wage decreases that workers at joint venture battery factories face compared to workers at older factories.By May 2023, the potential for a strike loomed over contract talks. In an online appearance in June, Fain repeated his goals and criticized automobile manufacturers for increasing their profits without increasing wages. Fain continued to leave strike action as a possible option leading up to contract negotiations. Contract negotiations began on July 14. Throughout negotiations, Fain has updated members online, including throwing one automaker's proposal in the trash on camera. On August 15, Fain announced a strike vote; it overwhelmingly passed on August 27 with 97 percent voting in favor. UAW has asked for an immediate 20 percent raise and yearly gradual increases totaling an hourly pay increase of 46 percent, the restoration of traditional pension payment plans and retiree health care, a four-day workweek, job protections, and a beneficial transition to electric vehicles. Fain has acknowledged the UAW demands are audacious but argues they are justified, pushing for the reversal of post-2007 wage cuts."
501,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Course of the strike,Agreements and end to the strike,"On October 25, a tentative agreement was reached between the UAW and Ford; it includes an 11% wage increase in the first year, and total 25% increase in wages over the 4.5 year contract, a $5,000 ratification bonus and a cost-of-living adjustment. When including cost-of-living adjustments, total pay could be raised by 30%. As part of the agreement, all striking workers Ford workers will return to the job while the contracts are ratified. Three days later, on October 28, the UAW announced a similar tentative deal with Stellantis; the same day, 4,000 workers at GM's Spring Hill Manufacturing subsequently joined the strike, despite late-night talks on October 27, at which Fain and General Motors CEO Mary Barra were reportedly present. On October 30, the UAW announced a deal with General Motors, leading to a suspension of the strike and a return of all striking workers back to the job.
All three contracts also eliminated the two tier system of wages, where some were classified 'temporary workers' and paid less. For example, at Ford a temp worker who previously made $16.67 an hour, now will be classified as permanent & make a minimum of $24.91 an hour. Those who are employed in or before 2023 will earn $40.82 an hour by the end of the contract if they remain, due to reaching full seniority by years. All three contracts are subject to ratification by the union's members; the first vote occurred at Local 900, the first plant to go on strike, with 82% of members voting in favor of the agreement. While UAW members would vote  to ratify contracts with Stellantis and Ford by over 69%, General Motors saw a significantly smaller majority, with only just over 54% UAW voters agreeing to ratify their contract."
502,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Transition to electric vehicles and claims of competitiveness,,"Automakers claim that they need to transition to building electric vehicles to meet government regulations and to remain competitive, and that this transition will require re-investing billions of dollars of their profits. Ford stated that for 2023 it would lose $4.5 billion dollars in its EV business.Foreign, legacy manufacturers and domestic manufacturers which produce only electric vehicles, such as Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid produce their vehicles with non-union workforce. Labor costs for EV-only Tesla are $45/hour. The second largest automaker, Toyota, has a labor cost of $55/hour. The current UAW labor costs are $65/hour. Wells Fargo estimates that the proposed contract by the UAW would raise the average labor cost to $136/hour. Ford, GM, and Stellantis claim that the proposed UAW contract would prevent them from being competitive in the transition to EVs and competing against foreign automakers.In 2022, president Joe Biden's administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included federal funding and tax incentives for domestic EV manufacturing. Ronald Brownstein of The Atlantic reported that union officials ""worry that the companies are using the shift ... to simultaneously shift more of their operations from high-paying union jobs mostly in northern states to lower-paying, nonunion jobs mostly in southern states"". Fain asserts that, with the government incentives, ""hundreds of billions of our taxpayer dollars ... are helping fund this, and workers cannot continue to be left behind in that equation"". The UAW seeks to mandate unionization of battery factories without a vote from factory employees."
503,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Reactions,Politicians,
504,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Reactions,Automakers,"Ford CEO Jim Farley claimed that had the UAW proposal been in effect since 2019, Ford would have gone bankrupt. In response, Fain stated ""The cost of labor for a vehicle is 5% ... They could double our wages and not raise the prices ... and they would still make billions of dollars. It's a lie like everything else that comes out of their mouths."""
505,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Reactions,Others,"In an opinion article, Steven Rattner, who served on Barack Obama's Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry during the government's restructuring of GM and Chrysler associated with their 2008 bankruptcies, stated that while he feels that the auto workers should get raises, they are asking for too much from an industry with thin profit margins that has stagnated relative to the growth of the overall economy.

506,Victory Road (2023),Summary,,"The 2023 Victory Road was the 17th Victory Road professional wrestling event produced by Impact Wrestling. It took place on September 8, 2023, at the Westchester County Center in White Plains, New York, and aired on Impact Plus and YouTube.
Twelve matches were contested at the event, including two on the pre-show and one taped as a digital exclusive. In the main event, Josh Alexander defeated Steve Maclin. In other prominent matches, Trinity defeated Alisha Edwards to retain the Impact Knockouts World Championship, and The Rascalz (Trey Miguel and Zachary Wentz) defeated The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) to retain the Impact World Tag Team Championship. Also at this event, it was announced that Mike Tenay and the late Don West would be inducted into the Impact Hall of Fame at Bound for Glory."
507,Victory Road (2023),Production,Background,"Victory Road was an annual professional wrestling event produced by Impact Wrestling (then known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) between 2004 and 2012. In 2013, TNA discontinued most of its monthly pay-per-view events in favor of the new pre-recorded One Night Only events. Victory Road would be revived as a ""One Night Only"" event in 2014 and a special edition of Impact's weekly television series in 2017.On May 26, 2023, Impact Wrestling announced that the 2023 Victory Road would take place on September 8, 2023, at the Westchester County Center in White Plains, New York, as they would tape the following day the 1,000th episode of Impact!, named Impact 1000."
508,Victory Road (2023),Production,Storylines,"The event will feature several professional wrestling matches that involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers portray heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines are produced on Impact's weekly television program.At Emergence, it was announced that Jordynne Grace would make her return to Impact Wrestling at Victory Road, after taking an hiatus from wrestling back in May. Four days later, on the subsequent episode of Impact!, Grace's old rival Deonna Purrazzo, furious that Grace's return announcement came after she lost her Impact Knockouts World Championship match to Trinity, would challenge Grace to a match at Victory Road.On the August 31 episode of Impact!, Alisha Edwards won a 10-knockout battle royal for the right to challenge Trinity for the Impact Knockouts World Championship at Victory Road.At Slammiversary, Kushida won an Ultimate X match to earn an Impact X Division Championship match at the time and place of his choosing. Over a month later, on the August 31 Impact!, Kushida confronted champion Lio Rush and declared he would invoke his opportunity for the title at Victory Road.On the August 31 episode of Impact!, Chris Sabin defeated Zachary Wentz in a singles match, which granted The Motor City Machine Guns (Sabin and Impact World Champion Alex Shelley) an Impact World Tag Team Championship match against The Rascalz (Wentz and Trey Miguel) at Victory Road.At Emergence, Kenny King retained the Impact Digital Media Championship against Johnny Swinger. After the match, King and his protege Sheldon Jean continued to attack Swinger, before being stopped by referees, security guards, and Tommy Dreamer. However, King would then assault Dreamer as well, with Kean holding back the referees and security. On the subsequent Impact!, Dreamer interrupted a promo by King and Jean, telling them about how much the match at Emergence meant to Swinger, who had learned his father-in-law passed away over the weekend. Dreamer then berated King and Jean for their behavior after Emergence, who had left the show before the main event. King didn't care, calling out Dreamer for being a veteran trying to take the spotlight away from younger wrestlers like himself. Dreamer would reflect on how the past year was possibly the worst in his life, from being diagnosed with skin cancer to the passings of his mother and mentor Terry Funk. He then challenged King to take the spotlight off him, offering his career for a Digital Media Championship match at Victory Road.At Rebellion, then-Impact World Champion Josh Alexander was supposed to defend the title against Steve Maclin, but Alexander vacated the title and was pulled from the show due to a torn triceps. Maclin would defeat Kushida to win the vacant title but felt unsatisfied as he wanted to beat Alexander for it in his hometown of Toronto. Several months later at Emergence, while Alexander was competing in an eight-man tag team match, Maclin, who himself previously suffered a groin injury, returned and diverted Alexander's attention, targeting his surgically repaired triceps. On the August 31 Impact!, Impact announced that Alexander and Maclin would finally have a one-on-one match at Victory Road.On the July 6 episode of Impact!, Bully Ray and Steve Maclin assaulted PCO, beating down backstage, pouring battery acid in his mouth, and finally lighting him on fire. PCO would be gone for the better part of a month, eventually returning on August 10 to confront Ray during his match and chasing him out of the arena. For the next few weeks, Ray would continually be targeted by PCO, never seemingly able to stop him. On the August 31 Impact!, when PCO again chased down Ray, the latter tried to explain himself by saying that he cared about PCO and that lighting him on fire was meant to kill the ""monster"" to bring back the ""man"" Carl Ouellet. Later, Impact announced on their website that Ray and PCO will face off at Victory Road in an Anything Goes match."

511,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Summary,,"From May 2 to September 27, 2023, the Writers Guild of America (WGA)—representing 11,500 screenwriters—went on strike over a labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The 148-day strike was the longest interruption to American film and television production since the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the second longest labor stoppage that the WGA has performed since the strike of 1988, which lasted for 153 days. Along with the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, which continued until November 9 at 12:01 a.m. PDT., it was part of a series of broader Hollywood labor disputes.
The lack of ongoing film and television productions resulted in some studios having to close doors or reduce staff. The strike also jeopardized long-term contracts created during the media streaming boom: big studios could terminate production deals with writers through force majeure clauses after 90 days, saving them millions of dollars. In addition, numerous other areas within the global entertainment ecosystem were impacted by the strike action, including the VFX industry and prop making studios. Following a tentative agreement, union leadership voted to end the strike on September 27, 2023. On October 9, the WGA membership officially ratified the contract with 99% of WGA members voting in favor of it. Its combined impact with the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike resulted in the loss of 45,000 jobs, and ""an estimated $6.5 billion"" loss to the economy of Southern California."
512,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Issues in the strike,,"One of the main focus points in the labor dispute is the residuals from streaming media; the WGA claims that AMPTP's share of such residuals has cut much of the writers' average incomes compared to a decade ago. Writers also wanted artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, to be used only as a tool that can help with research or facilitate script ideas and not as a tool to replace them. The COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath saw major reductions in the workforce and cancellations of multiple film and television productions to save money on basic residuals and music licensing costs, though Apple and Amazon remained outliers. The ensuing fall of ""Peak TV"" created worsening conditions for writers, as well as actors.On May 2, 2020, the latest Minimum Basic Agreement (MBA) became the collective bargaining agreement that covered most of the work done by WGA writers. The Minimum Basic Agreement was an agreement that established a minimum wage for television and film writers. In television, the Minimum Basic Agreement only applied to those who wrote for broadcast television shows and not for streaming television. This was very clear when comparing late-night talk shows that were produced for broadcast television, such as The Late Show with Stephen Colbert by CBS, versus The Problem with Jon Stewart, produced for streaming by Apple TV+. The writers who worked for The Problem were not covered by the MBA and therefore had to negotiate individually with the streaming company for their pay, and as a result, they were paid less than writers who wrote for The Late Show while doing the same amount of work. This pattern held true with other shows in the two categories. The MBA expired on May 1, 2023.The WGA estimated that its proposals would yield writers about US$429 million a year, whereas the AMPTP's offer would yield $86 million.One disputed issue is the Guild wanting requirements for ""mandatory staffing"" and ""duration of employment"" terms to be added to their contract, which would require all shows to be staffed with a minimum number of writers for a minimum amount of time, ""whether needed or not"" per the AMPTP.Another important proposal that the WGA is advocating for is to ensure each member of a writing team receives their own pension and their own health care funds. The AMPTP rejected this proposal and did not offer a counterproposal. At the same time, there was a tentative agreement between the WGA and AMPTP to have 0.5% of negotiated minimums for all WGA minimums shifted into pensions and health funds."
513,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Apr-23,"On April 18, 2023, 97.85% of members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) voted to go on strike if they failed to reach a satisfactory agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major film and television studios in Hollywood, by May 1. The AMPTP engaged in lengthy negotiations with the WGA on behalf of Amazon Studios (as well as MGM Holdings), Apple Studios, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Paramount Global, Sony Pictures, the Walt Disney Company, and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), but failed to reach a deal before the mandated deadline."
514,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,May-23,"As a result, the leadership of the Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) and Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) unanimously approved a strike on the eve of May 2, the first of its kind since the 2007–2008 strike fifteen years prior.The Hollywood Reporter reported that the WGA had set some prospective rules for writers during the strike. The Writers Guild stated that ""writers cannot do any writing, revising, pitching, or discussing future projects with companies that are members of the AMPTP.""The Writers Guild also stated that fiction podcasts that are produced by companies against which the Guild and its members are striking must stop production. The Guild said that they hoped that writers of animated series not covered by the Writers Guild but by the Animation Guild would seek advice from the Writers Guild on whether or not their work as a writer was counter to the activities of the strike and, if so, to cease such work for the duration of the strike. The Guild noted that while they cannot punish non-Guild writers who write for companies against which the union is striking, they promise to bar such writers from future Guild membership.The WGA instructed members to begin picketing on May 2, 2023, at 1:00 p.m. PDT.  Some places that the WGA has picketed include AMC Networks, Amazon/Culver Studios, MGM, CBS Radford, CBS Television City, Disney, 20th Century Studios, Lionsgate, Starz, Netflix, Paramount, MTV, Sony, Universal, Warner Bros. (including its Burbank division), 30 Rock/NBCUniversal, Broadway Stages, HBO, Silvercup Studios, Steiner Studios, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Warner Bros. Discovery Upfront.During the strike, the WGA instructed writers facing financial hardship due to the strike to apply to the Entertainment Community Fund. The Entertainment Community Fund helps people in the entertainment industry with financial trouble find affordable housing and maintain health care and senior care coverage. On May 10, 2023, it was reported that writers had pledged $1.7 million to the Entertainment Community Fund. Among the prominent donors were showrunners and producers J. J. Abrams, Greg Berlanti, Adam McKay, Ryan Murphy, Shonda Rhimes, Michael Schur, and John Wells."
515,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Jun-23,"On June 7 and 8, 2023, picketing in the Northeast (namely in New York) was paused due to poor air quality from the 2023 Canadian wildfires. Strike activity resumed on the 9th when air quality improved.On June 9, 2023, Lionsgate suspended BMF line producer Ian Woolf following an altercation with striking writers who were picketing outside of BMF's production headquarters. According to first-hand accounts from writers Gabriel Alejandro Garza and Tom Smuts, Woolf attempted to intimidate Garza and Brian Egeston, who were picketing on the sidewalk next to the studio's entrance, by accelerating his car towards them and stopping just short of hitting them. After first claiming that he did not see them, Woolf later admitted to trying to scare them. According to Smuts, Woolf later unsuccessfully tried to convince Teamsters Local 728 to cross picket lines, but they refused. Lionsgate released a statement saying, ""We take acts of intimidation and threats of violence seriously and investigate them thoroughly... As we continue to investigate, we have sent home the individual involved."" The WGA also released a statement, which read, ""Workers should not be threatened with physical harm when exercising their right to publicly protest and picket against unfair wages and working conditions."""
516,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Jul-23,"On July 12, 2023, Deadline Hollywood reported that the AMPTP and the major Hollywood studios did not plan to return to negotiations with the WGA until late October 2023 at the earliest. The studio executives who anonymously spoke with Deadline stated that by October, many writers would be financially strained to the point where they would lose their housing, which they believed would allow them to be in a better position to dictate the terms of any new deal. Representatives for the AMPTP distanced themselves from the anonymous sources, claiming they remained committed to signing a deal as soon as possible."
517,2023 Writers Guild of America strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Aug-23,"On August 1, 2023, the WGA announced that it would meet with the AMPTP on the following Friday to discuss negotiations regarding the strike. The location of the meeting was not disclosed. A spokesman for the AMPTP, speaking in relation to the strikes of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA, said, ""we remain committed to finding a path to mutually beneficial deals with both unions."" Both parties met on August 4, 2023, but no agreement was reached.On August 10, 2023, the AMPTP and the WGA agreed to resume contract negotiations, with the first meeting set for August 11. After that meeting, the Writers Guild sent a note to its 11,500 members saying the AMPTP had indicated a willingness to make concessions in some areas, including finding ways to safeguard writers from artificial intelligence technology. The note added, however, that the AMPTP had said studios ""were not willing to engage"" on other Writers Guild proposals, including success-based residual payments from streaming services. The note said guild leaders would not return to negotiations until studios were willing to engage on all proposals. However, the WGA sent a message to members that evening saying that they had received a counterproposal and were evaluating it.On August 21, 2023, picketing was canceled in Los Angeles due to Hurricane Hilary. The union, meanwhile, remained relatively silent beyond the message of August 18, 2023: ""Everybody is trying to step up and make a resolution,"" one executive told THR. ""There's more positive momentum this week than last."" On August 22, 2023, AMPTP presented a proposal suggesting rules for AI content, but talks between the studios and the writers remained at a stalemate until late September. On August 30, California State Treasurer Fiona Ma sent letters to Netflix, The Walt Disney Company, Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery, Apple Inc., Paramount Global and Amazon, telling them to return to negotiations and settle the strikes. She states that the impact of the strikes ""paralyzes Hollywood and reverberates across the state, affecting countless businesses, thousands of pension fund beneficiaries, and millions of Californians."""

The WGA condemned the action in a statement, stating ""Bill Maher's decision to go back on the air while his Guild is on strike is disappointing.

The draft opinion would overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey if held by the majority and thereby finalized in that form. Alito's draft decision called the Roe decision ""egregiously wrong from the start"" on the grounds that abortion is not listed in the United States Constitution as a protected right, and instead would allow states to decide on abortion restrictions or guarantees under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.Shortly after the release of the document, multiple protests occurred in cities throughout the country and outside the U.S. Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C., along with multiple individuals such as lawyers, politicians, and activist groups speaking out about the leaked draft.

Psaki added that Judges were a highly important function in the United States and must be able to do their jobs without concern for personal safety. The U.S. Capitol Police and the National Fusion Center Association alerted to potential violence in Washington, D.C., against the nine justices and their staffs as well as nationwide against abortion-related advocacy groups and First Amendment-protected events.

573,Bound for Glory (2023),Summary,,"The 2023 Bound for Glory was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by Impact Wrestling. It took place on October 21, 2023, at Cicero Stadium in Cicero, Illinois. It was the 19th event under the Bound for Glory chronology, and the second to be held in the Chicago area, following the 2019 event. The event also featured various wrestlers from partner promotion New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW).
Eight matches were contested at the event, including one taped for a episode of Impact Main Event Mondays. In the main event, Alex Shelley defeated Josh Alexander to retain the Impact World Championship. In other prominent matches, Trinity defeated Mickie James to retain the Impact Knockouts World Championship, Will Ospreay defeated Mike Bailey and in the opening contest, Chris Sabin defeated Kenta to retain the Impact X Division Championship.
The event was notable for the Impact Wrestling debut of Sonny Kiss, and the returns of Juventud Guerrera and Matt Cardona. The event was also the final pay-per-view under the Impact Wrestling banner, as the promotion will revert to the revived moniker of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling at Hard To Kill."
574,Bound for Glory (2023),Production,Background,"Bound for Glory is a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by Impact Wrestling. The event was created in 2005 to serve as the company's flagship PPV event, similar to WWE's WrestleMania, in which wrestlers competed in various professional wrestling match types in what was the culmination of many feuds and storylines that occurred during the calendar year. On January 25, 2023, it was announced by Impact Wrestling that Bound for Glory would take place on October 21, 2023, at Cicero Stadium in Cicero, Illinois, a suburb just outside Chicago."
575,Bound for Glory (2023),Production,Storylines,"The event featured several professional wrestling matches, which involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines are produced on Impact's weekly television program.At Emergence, Impact announced that NJPW's IWGP United States Heavyweight Champion Will Ospreay will return to the company at Bound for Glory. His opponent was later revealed as Mike Bailey on Week 2 of Impact! 1000, a match that was originally scheduled for Multiverse United in March before Ospreay sustained an injury.On the April 6 episode of Impact!, due to a torn triceps, Josh Alexander was forced to vacate the Impact World Championship. In his absence, Steve Maclin and later Alex Shelley would hold the title, with Alexander returning to confront Shelley at the end of Slammiversary. In the following weeks, Shelley took exception to Alexander calling the Impact World Championship ""his"" title, since he was never beaten for it. The two would continue to be reluctant allies, however, Shelley would at points abandon Alexander whenever the latter was in trouble, such as at Emergence. On Week 2 of Impact! 1000, Impact announced that Alexander will challenge Shelley for the Impact World Championship at Bound for Glory.On the September 28 Impact!, after Chris Sabin retained the Impact X Division Championship against Alan Angels, a video package played announcing the Impact return of Kenta at Bound for Glory. Later in the night, Impact announced that Sabin will defend the X Division title against Kenta at the event.On the April 13 Impact!, Mickie James was forced to vacate the Impact Knockouts World Championship due to a broken rib. Deonna Purrazzo and Trinity would become champion in James' absence. On Week 1 of Impact! 1000, James made her return from the injury, teaming with current champion Trinity to win a 10-Knockout tag team match on Week 2. Although during the post-match celebration, James was noticeably eyeing Trinity's title belt. On the following week's episode, Trinity defeated Gisele Shaw in a non-title main event, before being ambushed by Shaw and the SHAWntourage (Savannah Evans and Jai Vidal). However, James would emerge to help the champion fend off Shaw's associates. James later spoke to Trinity about how she earned her title but reminded her that she never lost it herself. James would challenge Trinity to a Knockouts World Championship match at Bound for Glory, which Impact made official on their website.On the September 28 episode of Impact!, the Call Your Shot Gauntlet was announced for Bound for Glory, with the winner as always earning a trophy they can use to invoke a championship opportunity of their choice at any time and place. A ten-person tag team match would be announced for the following week, with Champagne Singh, Dirty Dango, Eric Young, Jake Something, and Jordynne Grace defeating Bully Ray, Brian Myers, Shera, Jody Threat, and KiLynn King. The following week, the five of them would go on to face each other, where Dango – with help from Oleg Prudius (formerly Vladimir Kozlov in WWE) – pinned Something to earn the last entry spot in the gauntlet match, and Something was forced into the first entry spot.At Slammiversary, ABC (Ace Austin and Chris Bey) defended their Impact World Tag Team Championship against Brian Myers and Moose, Rich Swann and Sami Callihan, and Subculture (Mark Andrews and Flash Morgan Webster). At the closing moments of the match, The Rascalz (Trey Miguel and Zachary Wentz) appeared and neutralized ABC from the match, allowing Andrews to pin Myers and Subculture to win the titles. On the subsequent episode of Impact!, ABC invoked their rematch clause to challenge Subculture for the titles, but lost once again due to interference from the Rascalz. At Emergence, The Rascalz would defeat Subculture to win the tag team titles, when outside interference from Dani Luna, ABC and The Good Hands (John Skyler and Jason Hotch) allowed Miguel to blind Webster with spray paint before pinning him. On the first week of Impact! 1000, Bey competed in the Feast or Fired match, securing Briefcase 3 which contained a tag team title opportunity. On October 5, Impact announced that Bey and Austin would invoke this opportunity at Bound for Glory for the Impact World Tag Team Championship. On the October 12 Impact!, The Rascalz successfully defended the titles against Rich Swann and Sami Callihan, now going on to face ABC at Bound for Glory."

588,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Summary,,"On September 12, 2023, Kevin McCarthy, the then-Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, announced an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. The inquiry will be conducted by the House's Judiciary, Oversight and Ways and Means committees. James Comer, chairman of the Oversight Committee, will lead the investigation.
Speaker McCarthy initiated the inquiry saying that recent House investigations ""paint a picture of corruption"" by Biden and his family. No congressional investigations have discovered any evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden himself. The first hearing of the impeachment inquiry was held on September 28, 2023."
589,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Background,,"Since 2020, Republicans have advocated for investigations into the business dealings of Joe Biden's son, Hunter, who they alleged engaged in influence-peddling. They have sought to directly connect Hunter's financial affairs to Joe, and demonstrate that Joe benefited from Hunter's business dealings. A specific allegation that Joe sought to protect Hunter from a corruption investigation by arranging to have the Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin fired has been repeatedly shown to be false. They have also accused the Department of Justice of interfering in a federal investigation into Hunter, which has been ongoing since 2018, to grant him preferential treatment. To that end, congressional Republicans have launched multiple committee investigations to look into these allegations, including the House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family. By the time of the impeachment inquiry, these investigations had not produced evidence of wrongdoing by the president. Over the course of the committee investigations, McCarthy alleged that the Biden administration engaged in ""obstruction,"" although Oversight Committee chair James Comer said on Fox Business on June 29, 2023, that for every subpoena he had issued during his investigation, ""we've gotten 100 percent of what we requested, whether it's with the FBI or with banks or with Treasury.""Former president Donald Trump, as well as several Republican members of the House of Representatives and Senate, have expressed a desire to retaliate against the impeachments of Trump by impeaching Biden. Following Joe Biden's inauguration, various Republican members of Congress have engaged in several efforts to impeach him. The first of these articles of impeachment was filed one day after Biden's inauguration by Marjorie Taylor Greene, citing the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory. In the 118th Congress, Republicans were able to hold a majority in the House of Representatives, comprising several members of the Freedom Caucus. Kevin McCarthy, leader of the House Republican Conference, was elected speaker of the House after several days and many votes as opposition—primarily led by members of the Freedom Caucus—mounted against him; as part of negotiations, McCarthy conceded to his opponents and faced pressure from Republican members to either impeach Biden or launch an impeachment inquiry against him. The Fiscal Responsibility Act, an act drafted to resolve the 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis, weakened McCarthy's standing with members of the Freedom Caucus who opposed his negotiations with Biden.In June 2023, the House of Representatives voted to begin an investigation into Biden's removal and referred two impeachment articles written by Lauren Boebert to committee. McCarthy privately told his members that he would consider impeachment if the Oversight Committee investigation produced sufficient evidence. Trump has privately and publicly encouraged impeaching Biden. On Truth Social, he lambasted Democrats for impeaching him amid the Trump–Ukraine scandal. Leading up to the inquiry, Trump met with House Republican Conference chair Elise Stefanik and Greene, discussing impeaching Biden both times. In September, McCarthy promised in an interview with Breitbart News that he would only open an impeachment inquiry into Biden with a full house vote."
590,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Initiation of the inquiry,,"On September 12, 2023, Kevin McCarthy directed three House committees—the Judiciary Committee, chaired by Jim Jordan, the Oversight Committee, chaired by Comer, and the Ways and Means Committee, chaired by Jason Smith—to hold a formal impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden. McCarthy did not hold a floor vote on the impeachment inquiry and he did not appear to have sufficient Republican support to pass a floor vote. The chairmen of all three committees had been involved in preceding investigations into the Biden family. McCarthy asked Comer to lead the inquiry. When announcing the inquiry, McCarthy claimed that earlier findings of House investigations ""paint a picture of corruption"" involving Biden and his relatives, particularly regarding the business dealings of Hunter.McCarthy alleged that Joe Biden used his official office as vice president to coordinate with Hunter's business contacts and noted that Joe Biden was aware of Hunter's business dealings. He also brought up allegations that Joe Biden benefitted from Hunter's foreign business dealings. McCarthy argued that the Oversight Committee investigation demonstrated and warranted further investigation by the House of Representatives and that an impeachment inquiry would allow for a stronger investigation. McCarthy concluded the allegations by claiming that Biden's family was given ""special treatment"" by the Biden administration despite these ""serious allegations.""According to McCarthy, the impeachment inquiry would give House Republicans ""the full power to gather all the facts and answers for the American public"". Traditionally, congressional committees are given more sweeping authority to issue and enforce subpoenas when done so as part of an impeachment inquiry. McCarthy has drawn parallels between the Biden and Nixon administrations, accusing the Biden administration of using ""government much like Richard Nixon by denying us to get the information that we need"".Despite claiming that he would hold a vote, McCarthy opened the inquiry independently. McCarthy has defended this reversal, saying that then-speaker Nancy Pelosi ""changed the precedent"" in launching an impeachment inquiry into Trump in 2019, when Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry a month before a floor vote was eventually held to approve it. During the 2019 impeachment inquiry against Trump, McCarthy had asserted that he believed that an authorizing vote must be held in order for there to be a legitimate impeachment inquiry."
591,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,House committee investigations,,"The House Oversight Committee plans to focus on the Biden family and their finances, the House Judiciary Committee on alleged coverups, and the House Ways and Means Committee on tax sensitive information.Comer said that House Oversight investigators would seek additional emails dating back to the Obama administration and witness testimony from people alleging misconduct by the Biden family. The Oversight Committee also plans to pursue bank records for Hunter and James Biden, Joe Biden's brother. The Oversight Committee's ranking member, Jamie Raskin, has referred to the GOP investigation as a ""complete and total bust."" The House Oversight Committee officially held its first hearing on September 28.Jordan said that the House Judiciary Committee planned to subpoena lawyers in the Justice Department's tax division who worked on the Weiss special counsel investigation into Hunter, headed by David Weiss. The ranking member, Jerrold Nadler, called the impeachment inquiry ""absurd,"" and said that it was ""poisoning our vital oversight work.""The Comer committee issued a subpoena for Hunter's bank records on September 25, finding he received two wire transfers from Chinese nationals in summer 2019 that listed his father's Delaware home as the beneficiary address. Comer said in a statement, ""Joe Biden's abuse of public office for his family's financial gain threatens our national security. What did the Bidens do with this money from Beijing?"" Hunter's attorney Abbe Lowell asserted the wires were loans from a Chinese company in which Biden had invested in 2017, and he used his equity in the investment as security for the loans. Lowell said the money went into ""his new bank account which listed the address on his driver's license, his parents' address, because it was his only permanent address at the time.""Smith held a press conference on September 27 to discuss allegations of Biden influence peddling and a two-tiered justice system. Smith alleged that Hunter sent a WhatsApp message in June 2017, telling a business associate that he said he was not willing to ""sign over my family's brand."" Smith said it was clear that Hunter was referring to ""Vice President Joe Biden's political power and influence."" Joe's term as vice president had ended months earlier, but Smith said Biden was a presidential candidate at that time; Joe announced his candidacy in April 2019. Smith also discussed an email from a Weiss deputy telling investigators to remove all references to Joe Biden as ""political figure one"" from a search warrant for Hunter. When a reporter mentioned the email was sent in August 2020, when Trump was president, Smith suggested that was inconsequential to the underlying allegation of a two-tiered justice system. When pressed on the timelines of his comments, Smith said he was ""not an expert on the timeline"" but would like the Bidens to ""tell us about all the timelines.""On September 28, the House Oversight Committee held the first hearing of the inquiry. Comer said in his opening statement that investigators had ""uncovered a mountain of evidence"" and alleged Biden used his official government role for his family's gain, but committee members did not present clear evidence to support the allegation. Three expert witnesses called by committee Republicans testified there was not impeachable evidence against Biden at that point. Committee Republicans made several false or misleading statements during the hearing. Nancy Mace falsely stated, ""We already know the president took bribes from Burisma."" Jim Jordan falsely said Hunter had acknowledged he was unqualified to sit on the Burisma board, though Biden had said ""I was completely qualified to be on the board"" in a 2019 interview, but added he probably would not have been hired if not for his surname. Jordan also misled by suggesting the Justice Department improperly blocked investigators from examining Joe Biden. A Trump-era Justice Department prosecutor had directed that references to Joe Biden be removed from a search warrant for Hunter, explaining there was no legal basis to reference Joe Biden in the warrant. Byron Donalds presented a text message from James Biden to suggest that his brother Joe Biden would help in Hunter's business matters, though preceding texts showed the discussion related to the younger Biden's alimony payments and other personal expenses. Pat Fallon asserted ""Hunter admitted that he talked to his dad about business, specifically Burisma,"" referencing a 2019 New Yorker interview. In 2015, an Obama administration special envoy to Ukraine raised the issue of Hunter sitting on the Burisma board with the vice president. Hunter recounted in that 2019 interview that ""Dad said, 'I hope you know what you're doing,' and I said, 'I do'"".While McCarthy was ousted as speaker on October 3, McCarthy's successor Mike Johnson (elected on October 25) confirmed in an October 27 Fox News interview with Sean Hannity that the inquiry will continue. The previous month, Johnson had previously expressed support for the impeachment inquiry after it was announced, claiming then that he believed there to already be enough justification to impeach Biden. However, in his October 27 Fox News interview, Johnson took a different tone on his current judgement of guilt, claiming, ""we've not predetermined the outcome of this. We've not prejudged it.""On November 6, 2023, Comer stated that the Oversight committee would subpoena James and Hunter for testimony.On November 7, 2023, Weiss testified before the House Judiciary Committee, the first time a special counsel had testified before Congress during a probe. Weiss stated that he was the ""decision-maker"" in his investigation of Hunter, and that ""other United States Attorneys, the Tax Division or anyone else at the Department of Justice"" had not interfered in the case."
592,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Responses,Republican response,"Comer and Jordan expressed support for the impeachment inquiry's potential to provide them with expanded investigative powers, with Jordan saying that it would ramp up ""the pace at which we're going to try to get information from the executive branch"", as courts may provide more support for investigators' demands for information. Jordan has also said that a vote on the inquiry would be helpful in giving weight to the significance of the impeachment inquiry.At the time it was announced, there was a divide among Republican congressmen in their attitudes toward the inquiry. After the inquiry was announced, multiple Republican members of Congress expressed support for the inquiry, indicating that they believed there to be substantial enough grounds to launch one. This included House members Mike Garcia, Nick LaLota, Tony Gonzales, and Senators John Cornyn and Mike Lee. Some Republican members of Congress who had previously publicly urged against launching an inquiry adopted a pro-inquiry stance following the inquiry's initiation. Many Republicans in the more electorally competitive swing districts of the House of Representatives voiced support for the launch of the inquiry. Contrarily, multiple Republican members of Congress voiced concerns after the launch of the inquiry. A number, including House members Ken Buck,  Dave Joyce, Don Bacon, and Senator Shelley Capito, commented that they had not seen evidence to warrant an impeachment inquiry. In a Washington Post opinion piece, Buck—a member of the deeply conservative House Freedom Caucus—wrote that his fellow House Republicans ""who are itching for an impeachment are relying on an imagined history,"" specifically refuting their allegations that Biden acted improperly regarding the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin. However, some members who have raised concerns about the lack of available evidence still support holding an impeachment inquiry in order to allow for a complete evidentiary record, including House members Dusty Johnson and French Hill and Senator Mitt Romney. Other Republican members of Congress, such as House members Brian Fitzpatrick, George Santos, Senators Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, and Marco Rubio, have expressed concerns about ""cheapening"" and lowering the bar for impeachment. Matt Gaetz referred to the impeachment inquiry as ""failure theatre"".Trump said that the impeachment inquiry was potentially motivated by revenge on his behalf, stating that if he hadn't been impeached, ""perhaps you wouldn't have it being done to them"".Freedom Caucus members Matt Gaetz and Matt Rosendale denounced the impeachment effort as a political stunt in September. During an invitation-only video conference, Gaetz said, ""I don't believe that we are endeavoring upon a legitimate impeachment of Joe Biden ... I think it's for the sake of having another bad thing to say about Joe Biden."""
593,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Responses,Democratic response,"Biden responded to the impeachment inquiry by stating, ""Well, I tell you what, I don't know quite why, but they just knew they wanted to impeach me. And now, the best I can tell, they want to impeach me because they want to shut down the government"". He then stated that he was not focused on impeachment and said, ""I've got to deal with the issues that affect the American people every single solitary day"". The White House also sent a memo to U.S. news organizations, calling on them to ""scrutinize House Republicans' demonstrably false claims"" and disputing allegations of misconduct.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries vowed to defend Biden ""until the very end"" and compared the impeachment inquiry to a kangaroo court.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized McCarthy for bowing to conservative pressure and labeled the impeachment inquiry as a witch hunt."
594,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Responses,Response by academics,"At the launch of the impeachment inquiry, both University of Missouri School of Law professor emeritus Frank Bowman, Columbia Law School professor Philip Bobbitt (both of who have authored texts on impeachment), as well as University of North Carolina School of Law professor and constitutional law expert Michael Gerhardt commented that they had not seen anything they would consider to be evidence against Biden. They all consider this inquiry to be a departure from past presidential impeachment inquiries, which they say were preceded by significant evidence of wrongdoing by the president. Both Bowman and Bobbitt expressed concern that the inquiry will cheapen the concept of impeachment, thereby damaging the federal government's checks and balances. Calling the impeachment inquiry ""absolutely shocking,"" Bowman remarked that the Republicans behind the impeachment effort, ""have no interest at all in preserving the basic integrity of the process, or indeed their own power as legislators in legitimate opposition and tension with the executive branch."" Gerhardt called the launch of an inquiry ""an outcome in search of a process."" Gerhardt would later be called by Democrats as an expert witness during the opening hearing of the inquiry.Upon the launch of the inquiry, George Washington University Law School professor and constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley said ""the suggestion that [existing evidence] does not meet the standard for an inquiry into impeachable offenses is an example of willful blindness"". Turley was later called on by Republican members of Congress to testify as a witness during the first impeachment inquiry hearing, where he also stated that Congress had failed to connect Hunter's alleged influence peddling to President Biden. He also stated that some of the details they had gathered ""really do gravitate in favor of the president"". Turley had previously been a witness during the 2019 impeachment inquiry against Trump, having been called to provide expert testimony on behalf of Trump's defense, as well as a witness in the impeachment of Bill Clinton, testifying in favor of impeaching Clinton."
595,Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden,Analysis,Legal standing,"The House of Representatives is not legally obligated to start an impeachment inquiry with a vote on the House floor, as it is not required under either the Constitution or House rules. However, the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice ruled in January 2020 that impeachment inquiries are valid only if authorized by the full House, following the impromptu impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. The opinion remains binding on the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, as all are part of the executive branch. It also binds future presidential administrations unless revoked or superseded. The opinion finds that without a floor vote, subpoenas issued by House committees would lack the weight normally granted when pertaining to an impeachment inquiry."

628,2023 Louisiana gubernatorial election,Summary,,"The 2023 Louisiana gubernatorial election was held on October 14, 2023 to elect the governor of Louisiana. Incumbent Governor John Bel Edwards was term-limited and could not seek re-election to a third consecutive term in office. This race was one of two Democratic-held governorships up for election in 2023 in a state that voted for Donald Trump in 2020.
Under Louisiana's two-round system, all candidates appear on the same ballot, regardless of party, and voters may vote for any candidate regardless of that person's party affiliation. If no candidate had received an absolute majority of the vote during the primary election on October 14, 2023, a runoff election would have been held on November 18, 2023, between the top two candidates in the primary.Republican Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry won with over 51% of the vote in the primary. This was the first time a candidate won a Louisiana gubernatorial election without a runoff since Bobby Jindal won outright in 2011. Landry easily prevailed over several Republican opponents, including former state chamber of commerce CEO Stephen Waguespack and State Treasurer John Schroder. Former state Transportation Secretary Shawn Wilson was the leading Democratic candidate."
629,2023 Louisiana gubernatorial election,Background,,"Louisiana, like much of the Deep South, is a very socially conservative ""Bible Belt"" state. Democrats were the favored party at all levels of government as recently as the 1990s, however the Republican Party has since rapidly gained ground, first at the federal level and gradually at the state and local level as well. Today, the state is strongly Republican-leaning and, at the time of the election, Republicans held both of the state's U.S. Senate seats, all but one of its U.S. House seats, both of its state legislative chambers, and every statewide executive office except the governorship.
John Bel Edwards, a moderate Democrat, was able to win two terms as governor and overcome the state's partisan lean by diverging from the national party on certain policy matters, such as abortion, while also appealing to Louisiana's contemporary Democratic voting base. However, as Edwards was term-limited going into the election, most analysts expected the governorship to flip back to the Republican Party in 2023, primarily due to the lack of Democratic candidates with Edwards' crossover appeal."

The party had had a full-body meeting scheduled for October 29, but it was canceled, and instead the endorsement was voted on in an exclusive meeting held over Zoom. Landry and Eddie Rispone, a member of the Republican State Central Committee who supports him, had pushed the party to make an early endorsement, arguing that the Republicans' best chance of flipping the governorship was to unite around one candidate well in advance of the election. This move was heavily criticized by other Republicans who had expressed interest in running for governor. Lieutenant Governor Billy Nungesser said the party's endorsement process ""looks more like communist China than the Louisiana we know and love,"" State Treasurer John Schroder claimed it was driven by ""money and inside party politics,"" and Louisiana Senate Majority Leader Sharon Hewitt proclaimed ""the citizens of Louisiana do not need backroom deals and political insiders telling them who should be our next governor."" Michael DiResto, a member of the Republican State Central Committee, believed ""the idea that a small cabal would preempt the democratic process literally under the cover of darkness and in a smoke-filled Zoom goes against the foundational values of our party."" In response, Louisiana Republican Party chair Louis Gurvich said ""others who are crying over this endorsement are just upset because they didn't have the support within our party to win the endorsement for themselves."""

823,NWA Samhain,Production,Background,"On the September 5, 2023 episode of Powerrr, NWA announced that NWA Samhain would take place on October 28, 2023, at TempleLive at Cleveland Masonic in Cleveland, Ohio."
824,NWA Samhain,Production,Storylines,"The event featured professional wrestling matches that involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines were produced during the fifteenth season of the NWA's weekly series, Powerrr.On the September 5 episode of Powerrr, NWA Worlds Heavyweight Champion EC3 issued a challenge to NWA World Television Champion Thom Latimer to invoke his ""Lucky Seven Rule"" and face him for the world title. The following week, Latimer and his wife Kamille confronted EC3, with the former officially relinquishing the television title for his world title opportunity at Samhain. On the October 4, 2023 episode of Powerrr, Kamille confirmed that she would be in Latimer's corner for this match. On the October 17 episode of Powerrr, EC3 would bring up his and Latimer's previous history with each other, including at the previous year's anniversary show, where he and his Control Your Narrative henchmen held Latimer down and EC3 nearly hit him in the head with a chair.

The two teams would have a rematch a month later on the September 26 episode of Powerrr. There, Damage hit Murdoch with a chair, provided by Stevens who distracted the official. Knox would wrangle the chair away from Damage and attempt to use it himself, but when the official turned around and saw the chair in Knox's hands, he called for a disqualification, allowing BFT to retain again. A week later, Stevens was being interviewed at the ringside podium when he was confronted by Knox and Murdoch, who wanted one more opportunity at BFT and the tag team titles. Stevens granted them that opportunity at NWA Samhain, where they would challenge BFT for the titles in a ""Knights of the Round Table"" tables match (a standard tables match with the objective being to put your opponent through a round table rather than a long, rectangular table.)On Night 1 of NWA 75, Jax Dane and Tim Storm faced off in ""A Matter of Respect"" No Disqualification match. Some minutes into the match, Storm was suplexed by Dane and stayed down, appearing to be injured. Dane would be awarded the win via referee stoppage. On the following night's pre-show, Dane and his SVGS partner Blake ""Bulletproof"" Troop competed in a battle royal to earn an NWA National Heavyweight Championship match, only for the latter to betray the former and eliminate him from the match. Over a month later on the October 3 episode of Powerrr, Dane faced his former manager Chris Silvio in the latter's first NWA match. During the match, Silvio took a microphone and lambasted Dane for holding back on Storm during their match, going as far as to call him ""weak.""

On the October 10 Powerrr, after Rush and Rolando lost their match, Rolando was interviewed backstage declaring that a match between Rush and Pierce will happen in the future, with himself as special guest referee. The NWA later booked the match for Samhain, with the stipulation that the loser is forced to leave the NWA.On the September 12 Powerr, NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion Colby Corino and Joe Alonzo were on opposite sides of a tag team match. The two were clients of Jamie Stanley, but during the match, Stanley continuously interfered on behalf of Alonzo, leading to his team getting the win. As a result, Corino would defend his title against Alonzo in a ""Pillar to Post match"" at Samhain.On the NWA 75 Night 2 pre-show, Daisy Kill and Talos defeated The Country Gentlemen (AJ Cazana and Anthony Andrews) to win the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. Soon after their win, The Immortals (J. R. Kratos and Odinson) came out to confront the new champions, hinting at a future match. On the October 10 Powerrr, after Kil and Talos successfully retained against AJ and KC Cazana, The Immortals immediately challenged them to an impromptu title match. The latter team won by countout, meaning that the former retained their titles. On October 17, the NWA announced a rematch between the two for the Samhain pre-show.At NWA 75, Violent J of the Insane Clown Posse accompanied The Brothers of Funstruction (Yabo and Ruffo) for their matches, mostly as a means of sticking it to Vampiro, his former running mate in The Dark Carnival and current manager of La Rebelión (Bestia 666 and Mecha Wolf). With the two units going back and forth with each other, the NWA booked a six-man tag team match between them at Samhain. On the October 17 episode of Powerrr, Yabo defeated Mecha Wolf in a ""Pick Your Poison"" match, allowing his team to pick the stipulation for their match. The following week, Violent J announced the stipulation to be a ""Riddle Box match,"" where various weapons and objects are hidden in crates around the arena which both teams can break open and use the contents inside.
For months, despite actively competing on their own, Sal the Pal and Gaagz the Gymp have been trying to escape the control of Father James Mitchell. On the October 17 Powerrr, Mitchell, the host of Samhain, announced an Ultimate Hardcore Tag Team War, where Sal, Gaagz, and a partner(s) of their choosing would face NWA World Women's Television Champion Max the Impaler, Judais, and their own team.

Garza and Carrillo eliminated the Creed Brothers before the latter cost them the match. The following week, the Creed Brothers asked for a match against Garza and Carrillo and spun the Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal wheel, landing on a Tables, Ladders, and Scares match.In a digital exclusive on the October 16 episode of Raw, ""Dirty"" Dominik Mysterio interrupted an interview with Nathan Frazer, who wanted a match for the NXT North American Championship, but Mysterio declined, saying Frazer didn't deserve a title match. A brawl then ensued between Mysterio and Frazer. The next night on NXT, Mysterio and Frazer brawled again before Rhea Ripley, Mysterio's Judgment Day stablemate came to his defense. A title match between Mysterio and Frazer was later scheduled for Week 2 of Halloween Havoc.On Week 1 of Halloween Havoc, Chase University (Andre Chase, Duke Hudson, Thea Hail, and Jacy Jayne) were celebrating Chase and Hudson winning the NXT Tag Team Championship before Chelsea Green and Piper Niven took issue with their loud voices. Green threatened to file a formal complaint and asked to be directed to Shawn Michaels's office. Hail and Jayne offered to take them there and ask for a match for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship against Green and Niven, which was scheduled for Week 2 of Halloween Havoc."

831,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Summary,,"On October 3, 2023, the United States House of Representatives voted to remove its speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California, through a motion to vacate filed by Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, a fellow member of McCarthy's Republican Party. McCarthy's removal marked the first time in American history that a speaker of the House was removed through a motion to vacate. The vacancy started a process to elect a speaker that began following an eight-day recess.
In the 118th Congress, the 2022 midterm elections formed a narrow majority for Republicans in the House of Representatives. The Freedom Caucus, a far-right congressional caucus of Republican representatives, secured a minority of these seats. McCarthy faced significant opposition from the Freedom Caucus in the Republican Conference during the speakership election for the 118th Congress. After fifteen rounds of voting, McCarthy was elected speaker, conceding to his opponents by allowing any representative to file a motion to vacate. The potential of a government shutdown began to take hold in July 2023, with the Freedom Caucus—in demonstrations of austerity and defiance toward McCarthy—opposing spending bills to fund the government.
By September, the federal government appeared poised to shut down; the Freedom Caucus furthered its warnings to McCarthy by threatening to file a motion to vacate if he also turned to Democratic support. McCarthy nevertheless led the House of Representatives in passing a continuing resolution on September 30, with the passage being reliant on majority Republican and Democratic support. On October 2, Gaetz, a member of the Freedom Caucus, filed a motion to vacate, citing the continuing resolution. (McCarthy and his allies maintained it was motivated by personal animosity.) Following an unsuccessful motion to table by Republican Representative Tom Cole, Republican representatives debated McCarthy's speakership on the House floor. When the time for debate expired, the House voted to remove McCarthy, with insurgent Republicans and the minority Democrats voting against him. The speakership seat was immediately vacated and Patrick McHenry of North Carolina—a McCarthy ally—was made speaker pro tempore and the House went without a proper speaker until the October 25th election of Mike Johnson of Louisiana."
832,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Process and replacement,,"Removing the speaker of the House necessitates the use of a motion to vacate. As part of negotiations for McCarthy's speakership, any single representative can initiate a motion to vacate. The provision has only been used twice in the House of Representatives. In 1910, an unsuccessful motion was filed by Joseph G. Cannon against himself after a revolt. In 2015, Representative Mark Meadows proposed a motion to vacate against then-speaker John Boehner, but a vote was not officially called before Boehner resigned. A representative must file the resolution and request a vote; as a privileged resolution, the vote must occur within two legislative days. A vote may be blocked if the resolution is tabled or sent to committee. If passed, an internal list penned by McCarthy would appoint a speaker pro tempore until a new speaker was named. An election would then begin.Four candidates were nominated:

Majority leader Steve Scalise had been proposed as a potential speaker and won the Republican nomination on October 11, but he withdrew the next day.
Jim Jordan was the Republican nominee but was dropped by the House GOP conference after failing to win a vote on the House floor three times.
Tom Emmer was nominated next, but withdrew shortly after determining there was no way to convert 25 holdouts. Several members of the Freedom Caucus—including Representative Andy Biggs—reportedly had intended to coalesce around Emmer for his conservative values; Emmer had said he had ""zero interest in palace intrigue"". By the day of his nomination, however, over half the holdouts were from the Caucus.
Mike Johnson won."
833,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Background,McCarthy's speakership,"The 2022 midterm elections resulted in a narrow, 2-seat Senate majority for the Democratic Party and a narrow, 4-seat House of Representatives majority for the Republican Party. In the 118th Congress, the Freedom Caucus, a far-right congressional caucus, secured 45 House of Representatives seats. McCarthy, leader of the House Republican Conference, was elected speaker of the House after several days of voting as opposition—primarily led by members of the Freedom Caucus—mounted against him. McCarthy conceded to his opponents to negotiate their support for his speakership. In May 2023, McCarthy negotiated with President Joe Biden on a deal to resolve a debt-ceiling crisis and an imminent debt default. In response, Republicans, led by Gaetz, balked and blocked a bill protecting gas stoves against federal regulations. The mutiny left McCarthy with a political quagmire to either acquiesce to the insurgents, passing legislation that would face resistance in the Democratic-controlled Senate, or to negotiate with House Democrats, contending with a potential ousting."
834,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Background,Passage of a continuing resolution on the federal budget,"By September, the federal government appeared poised to shut down after representatives could not vote on a series of appropriations bills. The Freedom Caucus threatened to depose McCarthy if he turned to Democrats to gather more votes. On September 29, Politico reported that Gaetz had reached out to Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Pramila Jayapal, among other Democrats, about removing McCarthy. The following day, hours before a shutdown was expected to occur, the House of Representatives passed a bipartisan continuing resolution to fund the government through November 17. The resolution was passed in the Senate and signed by President Biden, averting a shutdown. McCarthy had relied on Democratic votes to pass the continuing resolution due to opposition from some House Republicans. The resolution passed the House 335–91, with all but one of the votes cast against it coming from Republicans. Gaetz, who had led intra-party opposition to McCarthy, announced in an interview with CNN that he would move to remove McCarthy for working with Democrats."
835,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Motion to vacate,House Democratic Caucus consensus,"Many Democrats would cite an inability for them to trust McCarthy as motivating House Democrats to vote as a unified bloc in support of the motion of vacate. There was also little on McCarthy's agenda that appealed to Democrats on a legislative level. Despite relying on Democratic votes to pass the continuing resolution, after its passage, McCarthy had attacked Democrats on Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan by accusing them of having attempted to obstruct its passage. These comments, amongst others, were seen as one of several instances in which he had established ill will and distrust among House Democrats during his speakership. McCarthy publicly ruled out a deal involving support from Democrats in exchange for concessions.On October 3, prior to the vote, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries asked Democrats to vote to remove McCarthy. The conclusion was that the pending motion to vacate highlighted the dysfunction in the Republican Party, which Democrats argued made Republicans unsuitable to govern. Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut said, ""They [Republicans] need to work this out.... This is not for us to get involved."""
836,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Motion to vacate,Voting and debate,"The motion to vacate was considered by the House on October 3. Tom Cole, chairman of the Republican-led House Rules Committee, unsuccessfully moved to remove the motion from consideration, through a motion to table. Following one hour of debate evenly divided between Gaetz and Cole, the motion passed by a vote of 216–210; this was the first time in congressional history the House voted to remove its incumbent speaker."
837,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Results,Vote to table,"The vote to table the resolution was primarily split along party lines; all Democrats present voted against tabling the motion and a majority of Republicans voted to table the motion. Republicans Biggs, Ken Buck, Tim Burchett, Eli Crane, Warren Davidson, Gaetz, Bob Good, Nancy Mace, Cory Mills, Matt Rosendale, and Victoria Spartz voted no."
838,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Results,Vote to vacate,"The vote to vacate was mostly split along party lines; all Democrats present voted yes and a majority of Republicans voted no. Republican representatives Biggs, Buck, Burchett, Crane, Gaetz, Good, Mace and Rosendale voted yes. Biggs, Crane, Gaetz, Good and Rosendale had been five of six Representatives to vote ""present"" on the last ballot of the January 2023 Speaker election.
Burchett said his yes vote was ""sealed"" after McCarthy allegedly said a ""condescending"" remark about his religious beliefs during a phone call. McCarthy said that he did not intend to upset Burchett.Mace, who is a member of moderate caucuses such as the Republican Governance Group and Problem Solvers Caucus, defended her vote by citing unfulfilled promises McCarthy made regarding the future strategy of the Republican Conference towards gun violence and abortion. Buck cited similar broken promises regarding the budget.
Jeffries and congressional Democrats said their yes votes were ultimately sealed by a video of ""an appearance Mr. McCarthy made on television on Sunday—the morning after Democrats helped him push through legislation to avert a government shutdown — in which he blamed them for trying to prompt a shutdown."""
839,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Results,Votes cast by members,"All House members of the 118th Congress that voted against party lines or were absent for one or both votes, are noted here."
840,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Aftermath,,"North Carolina Representative McHenry, a described close ally of McCarthy, was appointed as his temporary replacement as speaker pro tempore of the House. The House's legislative activities were temporarily halted as speaker pro tempore McHenry began an eight-day recess.Following his removal, McCarthy announced that he would not seek reelection as Speaker, leaving an open race to fill the office. This left the House Republicans in a state of uncertainty, as there is no apparent successor to lead the House Republican majority. The Republican Conference reconvened on October 10 to nominate their first candidate for Speaker, Steve Scalise, who would withdraw before a floor vote. Gaetz said he does not intend to run for speakership. Jim Jordan held three unsuccessful floor votes, followed by a short nomination of Tom Emmer, after which the final successful candidate Mike Johnson succeeded on October 25.
Former speaker and representative from California Nancy Pelosi was asked to move from her secondary office space in the Capitol by McHenry, who assumed full authority over office space assignments as speaker pro tempore. Maryland Representative Steny Hoyer, former house majority leader, also received a notice from Republican leadership to move out of his Capitol office space. Several outlets reported that McCarthy was behind the move, over Democrats' refusal to support him during the vote. McCarthy has remained in use of the speaker's office during the vacancy of the speakership position.Less than a week after McCarthy's ouster, Israel — one of the United States' closest allies — was attacked by the militant group Hamas, which began the 2023 Israel-Hamas War. McCarthy's ouster and the subsequent leadership debacle have been cited as the main reasons behind a failure for an aid package to be passed in support of Israel. Some McCarthy supporters attempted to use the crisis to reinstall McCarthy as speaker, but these efforts failed.On November 14, Speaker Mike Johnson ushered the passage of a stop-gap spending bill to avert a government shutdown in a 336–96 vote. Similarly to McCarthy before his ouster, Johnson relied upon the votes of Democrats to accomplish this (with 209 Democrats and 127 Republicans voting for the bill, while 94 Republicans and two Democrats voted against it). No effort has arisen to oust Johnson over this action."
841,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Responses,McCarthy,"McCarthy declared, ""I fought for what I believe in. I believe I can continue to fight, but maybe in a different manner."""
842,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Responses,Republican Party,"Former vice president Mike Pence said, ""Chaos is never America's strength, and it's never a friend of American families that are struggling."" Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said that Gaetz was ""actively destructive to the conservative movement."" Gingrich also said that House Republicans should expel Gaetz.Some Republicans blamed Democrats for not supporting McCarthy. Republican members of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus threatened to quit the caucus after Democrats voted. The National Republican Congressional Committee called Democrats the ""Chaos Caucus,"" a term originally coined to describe far-right Republicans.In a press conference following his removal, McCarthy blamed Democrats. He argued that Democrats should have voted against the motion to vacate to protect the institution. McCarthy also said that Pelosi had promised him that Democrats would support McCarthy during a motion to vacate.Adolfo Franco, a lawyer and Republican Party strategist, speaking from Florida, told Al Jazeera that it was a ""five-seat majority in a divided government"" that removed McCarthy. ""The reality is we have a democratic President, and a democratic Senate. We don’t have absolute majorities. Mr. Gaetz is living in a fantasy world. So I feel terrible for a man who has accomplished so much for our country to be ousted,"" Franco said.
Forty-five Republican representatives wrote an open letter objecting to the McCarthy ejection from his position as speaker. The letter said the representatives were ""ashamed and embarrassed by what happened"", and praising McCarthy's performance as ""one of the most accomplished Republican leaders in modern history""."
843,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Responses,Democratic Party,"On October 4, Jeffries released a statement wishing McCarthy well and saying that he and McCarthy ""had a respectful, communicative, and forward-looking relationship."""
844,Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House,Analysis,,"The Washington Post political contributor Dan Balz speculated that the ousting of McCarthy could hurt Republicans during the 2024 elections.Political observers have noted a historical parallel between the turmoil engulfing the House Republican Conference surrounding McCarthy's removal and the events following the resignation of Newt Gingrich precipitated by an internal caucus rebellion in the wake of the 1998 elections. The lead-up to the 106th United States Congress was marked by significant events, including the 1998 bombing of Iraq and the impeachment of Bill Clinton; during this turbulent period, Bob Livingston was briefly the presumptive speaker before he, too, resigned, with then-little-known Dennis Hastert ultimately becoming speaker on January 6, 1999."

846,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Summary,,"From July 14 to November 9, 2023, the American actors' union SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) was on strike over a labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).  As the longest strike in SAG-AFTRA history, its combined impact with the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike resulted in the loss of 45,000 jobs, and ""an estimated $6.5 billion"" loss to the economy of Southern California. According to Deadline Hollywood, the ""harshest pain"" was ""perhaps felt among the below-the-line workers who've had to sell or mortgage their homes, and wipe through IRAs to survive.""Along with the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike (which ended on September 27, 2023), it was part of a series of broader Hollywood labor disputes. Both the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes contributed to the biggest interruption to the American film and television industries since the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 just three years prior. In addition to standing in solidarity with the writers, the strike was led by changes in the industry caused by streaming and its effect on residuals, as well as other new technologies like AI and digital recreation. It marked the first time that actors initiated a labor dispute in the U.S. since the 1980 actors strike and the first time that actors and writers have walked out simultaneously since 1960.
Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP took place from October 2 to October 11, and resumed on October 24. On November 8, 2023, a tentative deal between the two sides was reached. Striking ended on November 9 at 12:01 a.m. PST."
847,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Background,Unionization in Hollywood,"The Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) is a labor union that represents approximately 160,000 media professionals and entertainers. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) trade association represents film and television studios in collective bargaining negotiations with unions such as SAG-AFTRA, the Directors Guild of America (DGA), and Writers Guild of America, East and Writers Guild of America West, comprising the Writers Guild of America (WGA). SAG-AFTRA was formed by the merger of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) in March 2012, allowing SAG-AFTRA to represent not only actors, but also journalists, talk show hosts, and other broadcast workers. The WGA and the Screen Actors Guild have not simultaneously been on strike since 1960, when actors joined striking writers over residual payments from films sold to television networks. The 1980 actors strike involved the combined efforts of SAG and AFTRA. The largest SAG-AFTRA strike since 1980 occurred in 2000, in which commercial actors went on strike to push for a continuation of the residual system against advertiser backlash, amidst the divisions between SAG and AFTRA.During the last decade and the rise of streaming, writers and actors have been frustrated over studio policy regarding residuals from streaming services; the decline of network television has led to a stronger reliance on other residuals. The 2007–08 WGA strike was motivated in large part by studio executives insisting that writers should receive no residuals from streaming services. The 2007–08 strike cost the city of Los Angeles an estimated US$1.5 billion, according to NPR. As with striking WGA writers, actors have expressed concerns about the use of artificial intelligence, noting that it could be used to replicate their likeness without compensation."
848,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Background,Pre-strike activity,"Weeks after the Writers Guild of America went on strike in May 2023, SAG-AFTRA's national board of directors unanimously agreed to pursue a strike authorization vote ahead of a renewed contract; SAG-AFTRA approved a new contract in 2020 that would expire on June 30, 2023. The union stated that it did not intend to strike but that it sought to give its negotiators ""maximum bargaining leverage"" ahead of negotiations on June 7, 2023. SAG-AFTRA cited several issues in negotiations, including ""economic fairness, residuals, regulating the use of artificial intelligence and alleviating the burdens of the industry-wide shift to self-taping"", and told its members that the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers would cut actors' salaries to ""pad corporate profits"". In a video released on May 30, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jean Smart, and Kumail Nanjiani appealed to members to vote to strike but reserved that a vote for strike authorization was solely a bargaining tool, not a vote to order an immediate strike.On June 5, 2023, SAG-AFTRA approved the strike authorization by a 98% margin, according to the union. High-profile members—including Quinta Brunson, Jennifer Lawrence, and Rami Malek—signaled their willingness to strike ahead of the deadline to achieve a ""transformative deal"", despite ""extremely productive"" negotiations. SAG-AFTRA agreed to extend negotiations to midnight on July 13, 2023, in an attempt to avoid a strike, but negotiations broke down in July 2023. SAG-AFTRA surveyed members on a strike on July 5, 2023 and began preparing picket signs two days later.The AMPTP agreed to a ""last-minute request"" for mediation from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service on July 11, 2023; congressional and public affairs director Greg Raelson stated that a federal mediator would be present the following day. In turn, SAG-AFTRA accused the AMPTP of attempting to extend negotiations beyond the deadline and reiterated that it would not continue negotiating after July 12, 2023. A number of high-profile actors, including Lawrence and Malek, then affirmed their support again by signing a letter urging the union to take aggressive measures and stating their willingness to strike. It was later reported by Variety that mediation collapsed after AMPTP President Carol Lombardini insulted negotiators by telling them to ""be civilized"" and avert a strike, which prompted a walkout by union negotiators. In response to Lombardini's comment, SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher reportedly said to AMPTP negotiators ""Now you've got two unions on strike"" as they left.On July 12, a statement was made announcing the construction of a Fast & Furious-themed roller coaster; the date of the announcement coincided with the deadline SAG-AFTRA gave before ending negotiations with the AMPTP, and construction began by the strike's start. This added to the construction that began on May 8, shortly after the WGA began protesting on-site, obstructing Lankershim Boulevard along the west end of the park's campus and parking lot and further restricting sidewalk access. The sidewalks in front of Gates 1, 2, 4, and 5 would be scaffolded-off and demolished in this construction. Despite prior advice from the Los Angeles Police Department's Labor Relations Unit to place K-rails from River Road to Universal Hollywood Drive for the safety of protesters and other pedestrians since WGA protests as early as June 6, none were placed by July 18, by which time reports of two protesters being struck by vehicles had been made.
On July 13, with no agreement between SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee voted unanimously to recommend a strike to the union's national board. The national board held a vote officially approving the strike. SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher announced the strike would begin at midnight on July 14; the cast of Oppenheimer left the film's London premiere ahead of the announcement to walk out. Joined by chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Drescher asserted that the strike was a reluctant last resort and described the proposed contract as ""moving around furniture on the Titanic."" In the press conference, Crabtree-Ireland alleged that the AMPTP attempted to include a proposal that allowed studios to, for a one-time fee equivalent to one day's pay, have exclusive and indefinite rights to extras' likenesses, including the use of generative AI to replicate them on screen. Media commentators likened this to the film The Congress (2013) and the Black Mirror sixth series episode ""Joan Is Awful"" (2023). However, AMPTP denied these claims, stating that their proposal would allow usage of these replicas within the specific film for which they are employed, and that any other uses would require consent and further compensation."
849,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Jul-23,"The strike officially began on July 14. As part of the rules established on July 10, actors cannot engage in film or television productions and cannot take part in promotional work, such as press junkets, film premieres, and events—including San Diego Comic-Con, which was scheduled for July 20–23. The strike action does not apply to SAG-AFTRA members who work under contracts that are negotiated by the union separately from the AMPTP contract, including broadcast journalists. Work in podcasts, ""micro-budget"" independent films, and student films is allowed, as is ""unscripted"" television work such as game shows, reality competition shows, documentaries, and talk shows. Internationally, SAG-AFTRA members are authorized to continue work in the United Kingdom under pre-established Equity collective bargaining agreements, as UK law criminalizes solidarity strikes. The HBO series House of the Dragon thus continued its UK-based filming with SAG-AFTRA actors operating under Equity contracts, prompting backlash among fans of the series.On July 17, the Ficus trees on Barham Boulevard's sidewalk outside Gate 8 were pruned almost entirely of their leaves. Pine trees on the opposite side of Barham were not touched, nor were a row of pepper trees behind the fence near the production gate. The pruning was described as a vindictive action because the trees had been being used by protesters as shade from the over 90 °F (32 °C) summer temperatures of Southern California. The pruning was also described as illegal, on the grounds that the trees are owned by the city and that Los Angeles' tree ordinances prohibit trimming them between July and September. NBCUniversal issued a statement to Deadline Hollywood denying that the trimming was done out of malice, claiming that they trim the trees outside the park in July annually for safety, and describing it and the obstructive construction hazards as ""unintended challenges for demonstrators"". NBCUniversal was fined US$250 for violating tree laws and destroying city property.Also on July 17, SAG-AFTRA released a twelve-page statement outlining the breakdown in negotiations, and terms they found unacceptable, including but not limited to a five-percent salary increase for actors, while the union had asked for eleven percent. The AMPTP released a counter-statement, highlighting that its actions were being ""deliberately distort[ed]"" and that SAG-AFTRA had chosen to pass over ""the most lucrative deal we have ever negotiated... valued at $318 million over the three-year term of the contract.""On July 18, NBCUniversal was accused of conducting business at Universal Studios Hollywood to deter or endanger the protesters and infringe on their rights to protest. In response, SAG-AFTRA and WGA issued a joint grievance to the National Labor Relations Board against NBCUniversal, accusing the company of interfering with their freedom to picket and endangering their members. Writers Guild of America West additionally filed a petition to the AMPTP in response to NBCUniversal's failure to install barriers to protect WGA and SAG-AFTRA protestors from the risk of being forced into traffic. NBCUniversal responded to The Hollywood Reporter in a statement: ""We are aware of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA complaints. We strongly believe that the company has fulfilled our legal obligations under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and we will cooperate with respect to any inquiries by the National Labor Relations Board on this issue. While we understand the timing of our multi-year construction project has created challenges for demonstrators, we continue to work with public agencies to increase access. We support the unions' rights to demonstrate safely.""On July 19, 2023, SAG-AFTRA approved more films to be shot during the strike, including Ishana Night Shyamalan's The Watchers, Sam Raimi's Don't Move, and David Lowery's Mother Mary. 56 films then became eligible to shoot under strike rules.On July 25, 2023, thousands of actors rallied Tuesday morning at Times Square from 9:30 A.M. to noon to voice their concerns about fair treatment and wages. SAG-AFTRA's main contractual negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland spoke about the struggle that the union is facing with the AMPTP.  Many celebrities gave speeches to express their concerns about the future of their union and technological advancements in the industry.  In attendance were: Lauren Ambrose, Matt Bomer, Christine Baranski, Steve Buscemi, Bobby Cannavale, Tituss Burgess, Liza Colón-Zayas, Bryan Cranston, Jessica Chastain, Gregory Diaz, Jennifer Ehle, Brendan Fraser, Nancy Giles, Danai Gurira, Jill Hennessy, Marin Hinkle, Stephen Lang, Arian Moayed, Christopher Meloni, Chloë Grace Moretz, Wendell Pierce, Michael Shannon, Christian Slater, Corey Stoll, Merritt Wever and Rachel Zegler."

Later on September 27, SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP made a joint announcement that ""SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP will resume negotiations for a new TV/Theatrical contract on Monday, October 2."""
852,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Oct-23,"On October 2, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP met for negotiations, in the first meeting between the two unions since the SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14. Unlike the WGA's negotiations, the SAG-AFTRA's negotiations were held at SAG-AFTRA's headquarters on Wilshire Boulevard rather than the AMPTP's headquarters in Sherman Oaks as, according to Deadline, SAG-AFTRA officials were displeased ""with the AMPTP's setup"" and wanted a change of scenery. Participants included AMPTP chief Carol Lombardini, Donna Langley (NBCUniversal), David Zaslav (Warner Bros. Discovery), Ted Sarandos (Netflix), Bob Iger (Disney), as well as SAG-AFTRA's Fran Drescher, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, and Ray Rodriguez. The meeting concluded with an announcement that they would meet again on the 4th. This pattern continued from October 4 to 9, when a joint statement announced a meeting on October 11. However, negotiations broke down on October 11.Beginning October 12, numerous reasons were given as to why negotiations stopped. Sarandos said that talks broke down because SAG-AFTRA ""introduced a levy on subscribers on top of [other] areas"" which he said was ""a bridge too far."" However, SAG-AFTRA accused the AMPTP of using ""bully tactics"", with SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher, stating that the AMPTP ""had given us a proposal package. We worked for like 36 hours on it. We brought it back to them. We walked them through it and they left and then called a few hours later and said, 'We're breaking negotiations.'"" Drescher has also said that SAG-AFTRA wants to continue negotiations. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland (SAG-AFTRA) also responded stating that, ""the public statement from the CEOs in their press release from the AMPTP characterized our demands as excessive. But really we don't think they are. The numbers they've been using are wildly overstated.""On October 16, SAG-AFTRA announced that it will schedule negotiations regarding a new video game contract.On October 19, Deadline Hollywood reported that a Zoom call between Hollywood stars (George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson, Kerry Washington, Tyler Perry, Bradley Cooper, Meryl Streep, Jennifer Aniston, Robert De Niro, Ben Affleck, Laura Dern, Emma Stone, Reese Witherspoon, Ryan Reynolds, and Ariana DeBose) and SAG-AFTRA leaders introduced a proposal that ""amounts to the town's biggest earners defraying the costs to AMPTP signatories by eliminating the cap on membership dues, to be used to bolster health benefits and other areas that SAG-AFTRA is trying to shore up. The offer would remove the $1 million cap on membership dues,"" and ultimately would have brought $150 million over three years. While Crabtree-Ireland found the proposal ""worthy of review and consideration"" as ""someone wanting to help is not someone wanting to undermine,"" Drescher ultimately rejected the offer, saying that it is not feasible. She instead called upon the AMPTP to resume negotiations with SAG-AFTRA.On October 20, actress and former SAG president Melissa Gilbert dismissed a message from SAG-AFTRA stating that actors should not wear Halloween costumes of characters from ""struck companies,"" and said: ""THIS is what you guys come up with? Literally no one cares what anyone wears for Halloween ... do you really think this kind of infantile stuff is going to end the strike? ... please tell me you're going to make this rule go away... and go negotiate!... people are suffering mightily... this is the kind of silly bullshit that keeps us on strike.""On October 21, a joint statement announced that negotiations would resume on October 24, 2023. After a full day of negotiations on the 24th, the initial plan of meeting on October 25 was moved to October 26. Negotiations thus resumed on October 26, with Crabtree-Ireland stating that they are ""100% focused on making a fair deal at the table ... I am cautiously optimistic that can happen. I don't really want to characterize what's going on in the room but we're really focused on just staying prepared and focused on getting the negotiations done."" An individual also speculated to The Wrap that ""studios believe that if they can’t reach a deal in the next week with the Screen Actors Guild, which has been on strike since July 14, then no new production will be able to start before 2024."" After the meeting, they announced that negotiations will continue on October 27. Also on October 26, a public letter signed by thousands of high-profile actors was sent to the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee encouraging them to keep fighting for their values rather than cave in to the studios' demands, saying, ""As hard as this is, we would rather stay on strike than take a bad deal.""On October 27, 2023, negotiations continued, but no deal was made, and it was announced that talks will continue over the weekend. The four studio CEOs did not attend the meeting, and Lombardini attended in their stead. The meeting on October 28 was conducted virtually between SAG-AFTRA leaders Drescher, Crabtree-Ireland and the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee, with the guild awaiting a response from the studios, and plans to meet again on October 29.Then, after intermittent communications on October 29, a guild source told Deadline Hollywood that there ""is a feeling of optimism... looks like we're in the final stretch."" Deadline also states that ""both sides expressed confidence a deal may be reached within days, but as before cautioned the situation is still fluid. From our understanding, SAG-AFTRA and the studios have gained 'significant' traction on bridging their gap over what has been termed as success-based compensation for streaming shows and their casts."" Late in the evening SAG-AFTRA  stated: ""Both parties will be working independently Monday and re-engage on scheduling at the end of the day."" The next day, Crabtree-Ireland informed Deadline that the weekend talks were ""productive,"" and he continues to remain ""cautiously optimistic about making progress."" Also according to Deadline, he said that SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP are ""not just 'dotting I's and crossing T's' just yet... He added that AI is the current focus of talks."" Later in the afternoon a ""well-positioned individual"" told Deadline Hollywood that ""There's still a lot of work to be done."" Another source told Deadline, ""there's a lot of common ground now, and we are building on that... details still have to be determined, but we're heading in the right direction."" That evening, SAG-AFTRA released a statement saying they would meet again on October 31.On October 31, talks ended early out of consideration of families celebrating Halloween, with the intention to meet again on November 1, and with plans to have further meetings later in the week if needed."
853,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Nov-23,"Meetings continued from November 1 to November 3. On November 4, SAG-AFTRA lead negotiators stated that they ""received an offer today from the AMPTP, which they characterized as their 'Last, Best, and Final Offer' ... we are reviewing it and considering our response within the context of the critical issues addressed in our proposals."" On November 5, SAG-AFTRA sent a statement to its members saying that the negotiating team had ""analyzed and thoroughly discussed the AMPTP's counter proposal all day and well into the night and will continue our deliberations on Monday.""  On November 6, SAG-AFTRA sent a letter to members that said: ""This morning our negotiators formally responded to the AMPTP’s 'Last, Best & Final' offer ... there are several essential items on which we still do not have an agreement, including AI."" Later that evening, Deadline Hollywood reported that the virtual meeting ended late, with plans to continue negotiations. A studio insider told Deadline that, ""this was a productive session, some work still required before there’s a deal."" On November 7, SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP met again. A ""guild source"" told Deadline Hollywood that they ""are very close ... not done yet, but very close with strong protection language in place."" However, the meeting ended without a deal, and with plans to continue talking on November 8. In addition, Deadline Hollywood reported that it ""heard from several sources that guild president Fran Drescher was pinged by A-list stars asking about whether a deal was nigh."" Also on November 7, Tyler Perry gave an interview on CBS Mornings. While praising the SAG-AFTRA lead negotiators, he also stated that the work stoppage has been ""debilitating,"" and that ""it's really important to know when we've won. This is only a three-year deal. In two years, two-and-a-half years, we'll be renegotiating again ... so we have to know what have we won, and what have we won for now? That's the thing. For now. [...] If I had ran my business trying to get everything at once, I wouldn't be here. I've got as much as I can for now, so let's see what we can do next.""On November 8, 2023, SAG-AFTRA released a statement to its members that announced the end of the strike: “We are thrilled and proud to tell you that today your TV/Theatrical Negotiating Committee voted unanimously to approve a tentative agreement with the AMPTP. As of 12:01am on November 9, our strike is officially suspended and all picket locations are closed."" The SAG-AFTRA's National Board committee then approved the agreement by a majority of 86%. The summary of the agreement would be published on November 13, 2023. Voting among SAG-AFTRA members began on November 14 and is scheduled to conclude on December 5."
854,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Strike activity and responses,Locations,"SAG-AFTRA's strikes in Los Angeles targeted the major film studios as well as offices for companies. Drescher personally joined the strikes outside of Netflix's offices. Josh Gad was among the protestors at Fox Entertainment's picket lines. Allison Janney, Kaitlyn Dever, Logan Lerman, and Joey King joined protests at Warner Bros., and actresses Constance Zimmer and Ginnifer Goodwin took part in picket lines at Paramount's Los Angeles studios. Disney's offices saw picket lines whose notable members included Mandy Moore, Michelle Monaghan, Raini and Rico Rodriguez, Danielle Fishel, and Ben Schwartz.SAG-AFTRA's New York picketing action took place at Paramount's New York headquarters at 1515 Broadway and various offices of NBCUniversal, including Rockefeller Center. Jason Sudeikis joined the NBCUniversal picket lines, stating that actors would strike for ""as long as it takes"", as did Joe Pantoliano, the Naked Cowboy, Alex Edelman, and Sarah Sherman. Meanwhile, at Paramount's headquarters, picket lines included Michael Schur and Kevin Bacon.SAG-AFTRA also staged brief strikes at other locations outside of New York and Los Angeles. Branded as ""Quick Photo Op"" strikes, these took place in Orlando, Honolulu, and Atlanta. The union stated it plans to launch more protests across the country, requesting that SAG-AFTRA members contact their local executives for details."
855,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Strike activity and responses,Media executives' response,"Before the end of SAG-AFTRA's negotiations, one anonymous AMPTP executive stated that their current strategy was to ""allow things to drag on until union members [started] losing their apartments and losing their houses"" to force SAG-AFTRA into less favorable negotiating positions.Casey Bloys, CEO of HBO and Max, said the strike ""will slow everything down."" He predicted the strike would heavily affect HBO's 2024 season.Bob Iger, the CEO of The Walt Disney Company, said the actors' demands were ""not realistic"", adding they were ""adding to the set of challenges that this business is already facing"". Iger has been criticized for these remarks in light of his contract with Disney, which allows him to earn as much as $27 million in 2023 between his salary and bonuses. TheWrap wrote Iger makes over 500 times the median salary of Disney employees, while Town & Country wrote it was actually 1,242 times a Disney employee's median salary. When asked about Iger's remarks, Drescher described them as ""repugnant"" and ""tone deaf."" She went on to call Iger a ""land baron"" who ""has no idea about what is really happening"". The Wall Street Journal also called Iger ""tone deaf"". Actor Bryan Cranston responded to Iger in part: ""We will not be having our jobs taken away and given to robots."""

860,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Notes,,
861,October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election,Summary,,"Following the successful motion to vacate the speakership of Kevin McCarthy of California on October 3, 2023, the members of the U.S. House of Representatives began holding a rare intra-term election for speaker of the House on October 17. In the 118th Congress, McCarthy's House Republican Conference holds the majority of seats. He had previously been elected on January 7, 2023, after an unusual fifteen rounds of voting in the January speakership election. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, also a Republican, served as speaker pro tempore until a new speaker was elected. This was the 129th speaker election since the office was created in 1789. On the fourth ballot of voting on October 25, 2023, the Republican Party's fourth nominee, Mike Johnson of Louisiana was elected the 56th speaker of the House.
Hakeem Jeffries of New York was unanimously nominated by the House Democratic Caucus on October 10. Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana was initially nominated by the House Republican Conference on October 11, but he withdrew from the race the next day. Jim Jordan of Ohio was nominated on a second internal Republican conference vote on October 13.
In the first round of voting, Jeffries received 212 votes from all Democrats, Jim Jordan received 200 votes from most Republicans, and seven others received some Republican votes despite not being formally nominated. As no person received the majority of votes cast, a second round of voting was necessary. On the second round, a net of two Republicans switched their vote from Jordan to other candidates. In the third round, a further three switched their vote from Jordan, bringing the total Republicans against Jordan to 25. As it had become clear Jordan did not have enough support to be elected Speaker, the House Republican Conference voted to remove him as the Republican Party's nominee for Speaker.
On October 24, the conference nominated Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who withdrew shortly after former President Donald Trump voiced his opposition to Emmer's candidacy. That night, Louisiana representative Mike Johnson was selected in Emmer's place, having previously come in second place against him.In the fourth round, held on October 25, Johnson received 220 votes and was elected speaker, while Jeffries came in second place with 209 votes. Unlike previous ballots, no Republicans defected, and every representative present voted for their party's nominee for Speaker."
862,October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election,Background,Process and nominations,"The speaker of the House of Representatives is the House's presiding officer, and the position is explicitly established by the Constitution of the United States. The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress (i.e. biennially after a general election) or when a speaker dies, resigns, or is removed from the position by a vote held during an active term.The selection of a speaker has the highest priority in the operation of the House, and is described in Rule #1 of the 118th United States Congress Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives. In past cases when the speakership has been vacant, the House has not conducted any other business until completing the election of a new speaker. Differing opinions have been expressed about whether this is the only action that is allowed to be taken during such a period, and particularly regarding whether the House could pass legislation during such a period or not, but it has never been attempted.Following the vote to remove McCarthy, House Republicans and Democrats held separate caucus meetings to determine who their respective party caucuses (the House Republican Conference and House Democratic Caucus) would support for the speakership. In such votes, both caucuses require a simple majority of caucus members in order for a candidate to receive the nomination of the caucus.Since 1839, the House has elected speakers by roll call vote. Traditionally, each party's caucus selects a candidate for the speakership from among its senior leaders prior to the roll call. Representatives are not restricted to voting for the candidate nominated by their party, but generally do, as the outcome of the election effectively determines which party has the majority and consequently is expected to organize the House. Representatives that choose to vote for someone other than their party's nominated candidate usually vote for someone else in their party or vote ""present"".
The Constitution does not explicitly require the Speaker to be an incumbent member of the House and non-members have received votes in multiple Speaker elections since 1997. Nevertheless, every speaker has been a member and the constitutionality of the eligibility of non-members to serve as Speaker is disputed.To be elected speaker, a candidate must receive an absolute majority of the votes cast, as contrasted with an absolute majority of the full membership of the House – presently 218 votes, in a House of 435. There have only been a few instances during the past century where a person received a majority of the votes cast, and thus won the election, while failing to obtain a majority of the full membership. One of these instances was in the previous speakership election, in January 2023 (118th Congress), when Kevin McCarthy was elected with 216 votes (less than 218 due to ""present"" votes, which indicate abstention). Such a variation in the number of votes necessary to win a given election might arise due to vacancies, absentees, or members being present but not voting. Upon winning election, the new speaker is immediately sworn in by the dean of the United States House of Representatives, the chamber's longest-serving member. If no candidate wins a majority of the ""votes cast for a person by name"", then the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected."
863,October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election,Democratic nomination,,"On October 10, 2023, the House Democratic Caucus voted unanimously for Hakeem Jeffries of New York (the incumbent chair of the House Democratic Caucus and House Minority Leader) to be its nominee. Jeffries had been the Democratic Caucus' nominee in the January 2023 speakership election, in which all present Democratic members unanimously voted for him across all fifteen rounds of balloting."
864,October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election,Republican nomination,Lead-up to first conference vote,"After the speakership was vacated on October 3, a number of different candidates for the Republican nomination indicated interest including Jim Jordan of Ohio, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, and former president Donald Trump. On October 4, Jordan and Scalise announced their candidacies. That same day, Troy Nehls of Texas announced that he would nominate Trump for speaker. Trump publicly considered running for the position, even weighing a visit to the Capitol to gather support for his bid. On the evening of October 5, Trump announced in a post on Truth Social that he would not run for speaker and instead would endorse Jim Jordan.On Friday, October 6, it was reported that a televised debate was planned to be hosted by Bret Baier of Fox News between Scalise, Jordan and Kevin Hern of Oklahoma on the following Monday. However, several Republican representatives criticized the planned debate as a ""circus"". In response, Scalise, Jordan and Hern each announced they would not participate, and the event was cancelled."
865,October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election,Republican nomination,Scalise nomination,"The first House Republican Conference vote was held on October 11, 2023. Prior to the vote, House Republicans tabled (killed) a motion from Representative Chip Roy that would have required the Republican nominee to receive 217 votes, instead of a simple majority, to become the nominee. Despite a challenge from Jordan, Scalise won the majority of votes, becoming the Republican nominee for speaker of the House. Only 212 out of 224 conference members cast a vote for either Scalise or Jordan. In an interview released shortly after the vote, Ken Buck claimed that he had voted present, as he was not satisfied with either candidate. Representative Cory Mills missed the vote because he was in Israel helping to evacuate Americans impacted by the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. Many lawmakers declined to run, notably Kevin McCarthy, Matt Gaetz, and former president Donald Trump.
Minutes after the meeting concluded, representatives Lauren Boebert, Bob Good, Nancy Mace, Max Miller, Barry Moore, and Lloyd Smucker said that they would continue to vote for Jordan on the House floor. Representative Carlos Gimenez said he would vote for Kevin McCarthy on the floor unless McCarthy told him otherwise. These defections were unexpected since abiding by the results of an internal nominee selection was ""historically a given"". With not enough votes to elect Scalise speaker on the House floor, Republicans decided to postpone the floor vote, which had been scheduled to be held that afternoon. On October 12, after another postponement of the floor vote, Scalise withdrew his candidacy. That same day, Representative Mike Rogers suggested that Republicans would have to work with Democrats to elect a speaker. Following Scalise's withdrawal, other Republicans and Democrats expressed openness to such a bipartisan coalition."
866,October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election,Republican nomination,Jordan nomination,"The second House Republican Conference vote was held on October 13, 2023. After losing to Steve Scalise in the first vote held on October 11, Jim Jordan won the majority of the votes, becoming the Republican nominee for speaker of the House, despite a late challenge from Austin Scott. Seven members of the conference cast a ballot for someone other than Jordan or Scott, and one member voted present. Mike Johnson also considered running, but decided not to, and endorsed Jordan instead.
Immediately after the second vote, the House Republican Conference held a validation vote asking representatives whether they would support Jordan on the floor. 152 voted yes, while 55 voted no. One member voted present.
During the four days between the Republican conference vote and the first floor vote on Tuesday, October 17, many influential Republicans who have opposed Jordan, such as Mike Rogers, Ann Wagner, and Ken Calvert, flipped to supporting him. Many previous holdouts changed their support to Jordan as he agreed to link funding for aid to Ukraine and Israel in their respective wars.
To build support for his candidacy, lawmakers and activists allied with Jordan took to interviews and social media to pressure Republicans to back Jordan. Several Republicans reported receiving threatening phone calls and text messages after voting against Jordan on the House floor. Jordan called for a stop to such threatening activities.With the Jordan nomination floundering on the floor of the House after two adverse votes, some members of both parties, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, expressed support for expanding Rep. Patrick McHenry's powers as temporary speaker until a permanent speaker could be chosen. While initially opposed to the idea, Jordan, on October 19, announced that he would back a plan to temporarily expand the powers that McHenry has as Speaker pro tempore until January 3, 2024. Later that day, however, he told reporters that there would not be a resolution to expand McHenry's powers, after it became clear that most House Republicans would not support it. Many in the conference echoed the sentiment that the resolution would be ""a giant betrayal to Republicans"", and some others noted that voting on the resolution ""might actually exacerbate divides within the conference"" and passing it with the help of Democratic votes ""would set off the fuse that would certainly end in civil war within the GOP"".On October 20, after three unsuccessful ballots in which an increasing number of Republicans voted against Jordan, the conference reconvened and held a vote on whether to keep or remove Jordan as the party's nominee. 112 voted to remove Jordan, while 86 voted to keep him."
867,October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election,Republican nomination,Emmer nomination,"House Republicans held a candidate forum for nominee candidates on October 23. Each member running for Speaker signed a pledge to support the eventual nominee. They met October 24, to pick a new speaker nominee from a field of seven candidates (originally nine). The voting took place behind closed doors via secret ballot. The candidate receiving the fewest votes in each round was eliminated. Voting continued until the fifth ballot at which point Emmer received a majority of the vote over Rep. Mike Johnson.
Immediately after the election, the conference held a roll-call vote, where 25 members indicated that they would vote for someone other than Emmer on the House floor or vote present.
After the roll-call vote, former president Donald Trump stated on Truth Social that he opposed Emmer’s bid for speaker and called him a RINO in front of the press. Four hours after Emmer was nominated, he withdrew from the speaker race after it became clear that he could not get 217 votes on the House floor."
868,October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election,Republican nomination,Johnson nomination,"Following Emmer's withdrawal, the Republican conference began a fresh attempt to select a new speaker nominee. A candidate forum began on October 24 at 6 pm.
The conference then held a roll call vote to indicate the level of support for Johnson's nomination on the floor. All named votes were in his favor, with three voting present and 22 not voting or absent."
869,October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election,Calls for a bipartisan coalition,,"On October 4, Democratic representative Vicente Gonzalez suggested that he would be open to doing a deal with House Republicans and vote for a moderate Republican speaker such as McHenry or Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick, who also co-chairs the Problem Solvers Caucus. However on October 5, Fitzpatrick said he has no interest in running for speaker and is only interested in working on behalf of Pennsylvania's 1st congressional district, saying it would be the only office he would ever run for.In an October 6 op-ed in The Washington Post, Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries proposed that ""Republican partners willing to break with MAGA extremism should work with Democrats in the chamber to strike a deal to form a 'bipartisan governing coalition.'"" Jeffries wrote that under such a deal, the ""House should be restructured to promote governance by consensus and facilitate up-or-down votes on bills that have strong bipartisan support"" and argued that this approach would ""reflect the inescapable reality that Republicans are reliant on Democratic support to do the basic work of governing"". In an appearance on All In with Chris Hayes on the same day, Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland suggested that moderate Republicans should strike a governing deal with Democrats and support Jeffries, an independent like Angus King, or an anti-Trump Republican such as Liz Cheney or Mitt Romney as Speaker. Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman floated the idea of former President George W. Bush becoming the next speaker.The task of selecting a new speaker took on new urgency with the start of the Israel–Hamas war on October 7. With all legislative activity in the U.S. House effectively halted while the speakership was vacant, a bipartisan consensus to authorize more military aid to Israel could not be formally acted upon. In addition, an additional aid package to Ukraine to counter Russia's invasion was a point of contention in the budget negotiations that averted a government shutdown on September 30; the aid to Ukraine was not included in the stopgap bill due to far-right opposition, but Democrats believe a majority exists in the chamber to enact it as a standalone bill. President Biden delivered an Oval Office address on October 19 in which he proposed $105 billion in spending to bolster U.S. leadership in global affairs, including $14 billion in aid to Israel and $60 billion in aid to Ukraine. Moreover, the protracted speaker election has impacted efforts to pass the federal budget for fiscal-year 2024. The continuing resolution enacted on September 30 expires on November 17."
870,October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election,Floor votes for speaker,Ballots 1–3 (October 17–20),"The election of the speaker began on October 17, 2023. At the time of the election, there were two vacant seats (Rhode Island's 1st district and Utah's 2nd). On the first ballot, Elise Stefanik of New York gave a nominating speech for Jordan and Pete Aguilar of California gave a nominating speech for Jeffries. Twenty Republicans voted for someone other than Jordan, and one was absent.Another round of voting began on October 18. On the second ballot, Tom Cole of Oklahoma nominated Jordan. Aguilar again nominated Jeffries. Twenty-two Republicans voted for someone other than Jordan, with no absent members. Jordan's opposition on the second ballot was greater than any opposition McCarthy faced in the January election. The Washington Post reported that ""a coordinated effort"" among House Republicans opposed to Jordan would ""ensure that he loses more votes each round"", which was indeed borne out on the second ballot.A third vote was expected to take place on October 19, but Jordan postponed the vote; instead backing a plan to temporarily expand the powers of Patrick McHenry as Speaker pro tempore. However, after a three hour closed-door meeting, a significant portion of House Republicans said they would oppose such a motion. Initially, Jordan announced that a third vote would be scheduled for later in the day, but the vote was later pushed to the next day, October 20.Another round of voting began on October 20. On the third ballot, former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy of California nominated Jordan. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts nominated Jeffries. Twenty-five Republicans voted for someone other than Jordan, and four House members were absent.
Observers noted that many of those opposed to Jordan's nomination were from the moderate and more traditionally conservative wings of the party, many of whom represent competitive districts where voting for Jordan, seen as a right-wing figure, may be politically detrimental. Several Republicans who voted against Jordan on the first two ballots reported receiving death threats and other threats to their safety, to themselves and their family members. Ken Buck, Drew Ferguson, and Mariannette Miller-Meeks each said they received death threats. Don Bacon said his wife received threatening messages, and Ferguson said credible threats prompted him to dispatch a sheriff to his daughter's school.Following the third ballot, the Republican conference voted by secret ballot to remove Jordan as their nominee."
871,October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election,Floor votes for speaker,Ballot 4 (October 25),"A fourth speaker ballot occurred on October 25. On the fourth ballot, Elise Stefanik of New York gave a nominating speech for Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Pete Aguilar of California gave a nominating speech for Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Johnson was elected with 220 votes, surpassing the 215-vote threshold required to win with 429 members present. On the fourth ballot, every present member voted for their party nominee; there were no defectors."

875,2023 Tejano Music Awards,Summary,,"The 43rd Annual Tejano Music Awards ceremony was held on October 21, 2023, at the Boeing Center at Tech Port in San Antonio, Texas. Those who performed at the ceremony were Siggno, Ricardo Castillon, Isabel Marie, Angelica Y Moneda, Grupo Asalto, Suenatron, and Paula DeAnda.
On September 28, 2023, it was revealed that Joe Lopez and Humberto ""Beto"" Ramon would have been receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award. The 2023 Tejano Music Awards Fan Fair that preceded the awards ceremony, drew 125,000 people during the four-day event. More than 100 musicians performed during the event.The biggest winners were Siggno's Jesse Turner (Male Vocalist of the Year and Tejano Album of the Year), and Mike Gonzalez & The Iconiczz (Best New Group and Best New Female Artist for Di Marie). With five nominations, Monica Saldivar was the most nominated artist. Destiny Navaira earned her second Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year, her last time was at the 41st Tejano Music Awards in 2021. Beto Ramon was the sole honoree of the Lifetime Achievement Award after the organization decided to rescind Joe Lopez following widespread public outcry regarding the singer's recognition, stemming from his 2006 conviction for multiple sex offenses."
876,2023 Tejano Music Awards,Awards,,"Winners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger (‡)."
877,2023 Tejano Music Awards,Controversy,,"Following the announcement that Joe Lopez, a former musician for Grupo Mazz, would be receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award during the awards ceremony, the Forever Jimmy G Organization had taken to social media to express their apprehensions and request that the Texas Talent Musicians Association (TTMA), the producers of the Tejano Music Awards, to rectify misinformation propagated in an email sent to their followers and the media. According to the organization, the email wrongly attributed Grammy Awards won by Jimmy Gonzalez, lead singer of Grupo Mazz, during his solo career from 1999 to 2018 to Joe Lopez, in a biography falsely crediting him as the recipient. The statement argues that this enables Lopez to impersonate Gonzalez and his career achievements, including the claim that Lopez is the founder of Group Mazz and thus entitled to Gonzalez's awards. The statement contends that Gonzalez effectively carried on with Grupo Mazz after Lopez's departure in 1997, leading to Grammy and Latin Grammy Awards for Best Tejano Album between 2001 and 2004, 2009, and 2014. Public records confirm Gonzalez registered the name Mazz in 2000, maintaining it until his death in 2018. The organization stresses that Lopez was incarcerated from 2006 to 2017, during which time he was neither actively nor publicly receiving awards. Allowing Lopez to claim these honors, they argue, is misleading and undermines Gonzalez's contributions to Tejano music. The organization urged Gonzalez's fans, family, friends, and musicians to protest the TTMA.On September 30, 2023, the TTMA updated its biography for Lopez through an email to its followers and media outlets. The revised version eliminated the inaccurate claims and gave more credit to Gonzalez. The email also included an apology for any confusion or offense caused by the original biography. The TTMA explained in the email that they had obtained the biography information from ""in-the-know sources"" but recognized that certain crucial details may have been misleading or incorrect. The website, Tejano Nation, commented that the TTMA did not address another contentious issue related to Lopez's recognition as it relates to his status as a paroled sex offender. Fans of Tejano music and industry professionals have expressed their anger and disappointment at the TTMA's decision to give a Lifetime Achievement Award to Lopez, given his criminal history. According to Tejano Nation, the TTMA has not issued a statement on this matter and believes that TTMA has not ""indicated any plans to rescind or reconsider Lopez's award""."

882,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Summary,,"The 2023 United Auto Workers strike was a labor strike involving automobile workers in the labor union United Auto Workers (UAW) and the three unionized automakers in the United States—Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Stellantis. These three automakers' factories combined employ about 145,000 UAW members and produce about 50 percent of the vehicles manufactured annually in the US, accounting for 1.5 percent of US GDP. The strike began on September 15, 2023, when the union was unable to reach a deal with the three automakers. It was the first trilateral strike against the three automakers in the union's history.
The hardline stance taken by the newly elected UAW president Shawn Fain contributed to the UAW's decision to strike. In particular, he has criticized stagnant wages that do not account for inflation and has called for the end of a tiered employment system that underpays newer employees, the restoration of overtime and retirement benefits that were lost as a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the institution of a four-day workweek, and improved worker protections against plant closures as electric vehicle production increases.
A central concern for the automakers is the cost of labor relative to domestic and foreign non-union competitors, particularly as the industry transitions to electric vehicle manufacturing. The automakers have stated that they anticipate the need to invest a significant portion of their profits from gasoline-powered vehicles into new production technology for electric vehicles.The strike was suspended in the last week of October as the automakers made tentative deals that largely matched the UAW demands, starting with Ford on October 25, followed by Stellantis on October 28 and finally General Motors on October 30. In announcing the deals with the automakers, UAW instructed workers to return to the job, thus ending the 46-day labor strike on October 30th. The new contracts would be ratified when individual UAW membership voting with all three companies ended from November 16-17 2023."
883,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Background,United Auto Workers,"The labor union United Auto Workers (UAW) represents approximately 145,000 automobile workers employed at Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Stellantis. To achieve its goals, UAW has engaged in strike action; from November 1945 to March 1946, UAW went on strike against General Motors. The 1945—1946 strike established a strategy, forged by then-UAW president Walter Reuther, to target efforts on a single company. Since the 1950s, UAW has faced declining union membership and a growing service sector, reducing the economic impact that a strike could have. In 2019, UAW autoworkers went on strike against General Motors. The 40-day work stoppage cost General Motors US$3.6 billion and caused a single-quarter recession in Michigan."
884,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Background,Contract negotiations,"In March 2023, newly elected UAW president Shawn Fain stated that workers were ""fed up with the status quo"" and assured that he would negotiate for changes to workers' contracts. Fain called for cost of living adjustments to account for inflation ahead of the current contracts expiring on September 14 and asked for wage increases lost in the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Members have expressed interest in both ending a two-tier wage system in which newer employees are paid significantly less than older employees, and domestic plant construction. Fain continued his sentiments at the Automotive Press Association in April, expressing disappointment in the idling of the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Belvidere, Illinois. Additionally, he lambasted wage decreases that workers at joint venture battery factories face compared to workers at older factories.By May 2023, the potential for a strike loomed over contract talks. In an online appearance in June, Fain repeated his goals and criticized automobile manufacturers for increasing their profits without increasing wages. Fain continued to leave strike action as a possible option leading up to contract negotiations. Contract negotiations began on July 14. Throughout negotiations, Fain has updated members online, including throwing one automaker's proposal in the trash on camera. On August 15, Fain announced a strike vote; it overwhelmingly passed on August 27 with 97 percent voting in favor. UAW has asked for an immediate 20 percent raise and yearly gradual increases totaling an hourly pay increase of 46 percent, the restoration of traditional pension payment plans and retiree health care, a four-day workweek, job protections, and a beneficial transition to electric vehicles. Fain has acknowledged the UAW demands are audacious but argues they are justified, pushing for the reversal of post-2007 wage cuts."
885,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Course of the strike,Agreements and end to the strike,"On October 25, a tentative agreement was reached between the UAW and Ford; it includes an 11% wage increase in the first year, and total 25% increase in wages over the 4.5 year contract, a $5,000 ratification bonus and a cost-of-living adjustment. When including cost-of-living adjustments, total pay could be raised by 30%. As part of the agreement, all striking workers Ford workers will return to the job while the contracts are ratified. Three days later, on October 28, the UAW announced a similar tentative deal with Stellantis; the same day, 4,000 workers at GM's Spring Hill Manufacturing subsequently joined the strike, despite late-night talks on October 27, at which Fain and General Motors CEO Mary Barra were reportedly present. On October 30, the UAW announced a deal with General Motors, leading to a suspension of the strike and a return of all striking workers back to the job.
All three contracts also eliminated the two tier system of wages, where some were classified 'temporary workers' and paid less. For example, at Ford a temp worker who previously made $16.67 an hour, now will be classified as permanent & make a minimum of $24.91 an hour. Those who are employed in or before 2023 will earn $40.82 an hour by the end of the contract if they remain, due to reaching full seniority by years. All three contracts are subject to ratification by the union's members; the first vote occurred at Local 900, the first plant to go on strike, with 82% of members voting in favor of the agreement. While UAW members would vote  to ratify contracts with Stellantis and Ford by over 69%, General Motors saw a significantly smaller majority, with only just over 54% UAW voters agreeing to ratify their contract."
886,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Transition to electric vehicles and claims of competitiveness,,"Automakers claim that they need to transition to building electric vehicles to meet government regulations and to remain competitive, and that this transition will require re-investing billions of dollars of their profits. Ford stated that for 2023 it would lose $4.5 billion dollars in its EV business.Foreign, legacy manufacturers and domestic manufacturers which produce only electric vehicles, such as Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid produce their vehicles with non-union workforce. Labor costs for EV-only Tesla are $45/hour. The second largest automaker, Toyota, has a labor cost of $55/hour. The current UAW labor costs are $65/hour. Wells Fargo estimates that the proposed contract by the UAW would raise the average labor cost to $136/hour. Ford, GM, and Stellantis claim that the proposed UAW contract would prevent them from being competitive in the transition to EVs and competing against foreign automakers.In 2022, president Joe Biden's administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included federal funding and tax incentives for domestic EV manufacturing. Ronald Brownstein of The Atlantic reported that union officials ""worry that the companies are using the shift ... to simultaneously shift more of their operations from high-paying union jobs mostly in northern states to lower-paying, nonunion jobs mostly in southern states"". Fain asserts that, with the government incentives, ""hundreds of billions of our taxpayer dollars ... are helping fund this, and workers cannot continue to be left behind in that equation"". The UAW seeks to mandate unionization of battery factories without a vote from factory employees."
887,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Reactions,Politicians,
888,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Reactions,Automakers,"Ford CEO Jim Farley claimed that had the UAW proposal been in effect since 2019, Ford would have gone bankrupt. In response, Fain stated ""The cost of labor for a vehicle is 5% ... They could double our wages and not raise the prices ... and they would still make billions of dollars. It's a lie like everything else that comes out of their mouths."""
889,2023 United Auto Workers strike,Reactions,Others,"In an opinion article, Steven Rattner, who served on Barack Obama's Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry during the government's restructuring of GM and Chrysler associated with their 2008 bankruptcies, stated that while he feels that the auto workers should get raises, they are asking for too much from an industry with thin profit margins that has stagnated relative to the growth of the overall economy.


"
890,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Summary,,"United States of America v. Samuel Bankman-Fried was a 2023 federal criminal trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Financial entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, commonly known as SBF, was convicted on seven charges of fraud and conspiracy following the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022.The trial received significant media attention, with daily coverage from major news outlets. Prior to his company's collapse, Bankman-Fried was celebrated as ""a kind of poster boy for crypto"" and FTX had a global reach with more than 130 international affiliates. Some commentators said that the entire cryptocurrency industry was ""on trial with him""."
891,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Background,,"Headquartered in the Bahamas, FTX was at one time the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume in the world. One of its customers, Alameda Research, was also co-founded and majority-owned by Bankman-Fried, and the CEOs of the two companies dated on and off until April 2022.Following a spike in withdrawals and subsequent liquidity crisis, on November 11, 2022, FTX and more than 130 associated legal entities declared bankruptcy. Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO and was replaced by John J. Ray III to manage the bankruptcy proceedings.On December 12, 2022, prosecutors charged Bankman-Fried on eight counts of fraud and conspiracy, one of which was subsequently dropped. Later that day, he was arrested by the Royal Bahamas Police Force and ten days later, he consented to his extradition to the United States to face trial. He was released on a $250 million bond until August 11, 2023, at which point he was remanded into custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, following accusations of witness tampering.A second trial is scheduled for March 2024, at which Bankman-Fried will face a further five charges, including an alleged $40 million bribe to Chinese authorities to unlock $1 billion of Alameda's trading funds."
892,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Charges,,"In the October 2023 trial, Bankman-Fried faced seven charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice:
Conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers
Wire fraud on customers
Conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders
Wire fraud on lenders
Conspiracy to commit commodities fraud
Conspiracy to commit securities fraud
Conspiracy to commit money launderingThe indictment claims that the scheme began in 2019 and involved lying to Alameda's lenders, as well as to FTX investors and customers. Bankman-Fried faces to up to 110 years in prison.Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to all seven charges. According to Michael Lewis—a financial journalist who met with Bankman-Fried over a hundred times—Bankman-Fried ""genuinely thinks he's innocent"". (Lewis also reported that ""some of [the prosecution's witnesses] have said to me, 'I think Sam is innocent.'"") In a private message to Vox writer Kelsey Piper, Bankman-Fried explained that ""each individual decision seemed fine and I didn't realize how big their sum was until the end"" and that his tweets about FTX not investing customer deposits were ""factually accurate"" since Alameda was the one investing them. When Piper asked, ""FTX had just loaned their money to Alameda, who had gambled with their money, and lost it? and you didn't realize it was a big deal because you didn't realize how much money it was?"" Bankman-Fried replied, ""and also thought Alameda had enough collateral to reasonably cover it""."
893,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Opening statements,,"The trial began on October 3, 2023 in the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse in Manhattan, New York City, with district judge Lewis Kaplan presiding. The prosecution is led by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nicolas Roos and Danielle Sassoon. Attorney Mark Cohen leads the defense.The prosecution opened by portraying Bankman-Fried as a villainous, greedy con man. They claimed that he misled investors and said that in loaning FTX customer deposits to Alameda, he ""stole billions from thousands of people"". To support their accusations, they referenced FTX's terms of service which told customers, ""Title to your Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to FTX Trading.""The defense presented Bankman-Fried as a ""math nerd who didn't drink or party"" and who ""reasonably believed that there were no laws or provisions in the terms of service that prohibited FTX from loaning out these deposits, whether loans went to Alameda or to other customers"". Drawing attention to another part of the terms of service, the defense argued that as a customer engaged in margin trading, Alameda was allowed to borrow money from FTX.The problems, according to the defense, stemmed from the poor management of Alameda by its CEO, Caroline Ellison. The court were told that Ellison refused Bankman-Fried's advice to scale down her risky trading strategies. The prosecution, however, planned to demonstrate that with respect to Alameda's strategy, Bankman-Fried was ""calling the shots"".The overall picture painted by the prosecution was of an accumulation of wealth and power ""built on lies"", while the defense declared, ""It's not a crime to be the CEO of a company that later files for bankruptcy""."
894,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Witnesses for the prosecution,Caroline Ellison,"Caroline Ellison is the former CEO of Bankman-Fried's company Alameda Research. In her testimony, she described how Bankman-Fried had ""directed"" her to ""commit crimes"" during her time at Alameda, adding that ""Alameda took several billion dollars from FTX customers and used it for its own investments"" and to pay back its lenders. Ellison, who has pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud and conspiracy as part of a cooperation deal with prosecutors, told the court that she had sent ""dishonest"" balance sheets to these lenders to conceal the taking of customer funds. She also testified that she had been concerned about ""insiders"" taking out a total of around $5 billion in personal loans from Alameda, saying, ""Sam directed us to borrow as much money as we could at whatever terms we could"".Initially, Alameda and FTX were run by the same team. Ellison told the court that early on, Bankman-Fried had ""set up a system that allowed Alameda to borrow from FTX"". Before FTX had its own bank account, Alameda would receive some FTX customer funds into its own bank account, and then some of those funds were spent on expenses, loan repayments, and investments. Alameda also had a $65 billion line of credit on FTX and did not have to post collateral when borrowing, she said. Alameda had been FTX's first and only liquidity provider for a time, but the growth of the exchange attracted others, and eventually Alameda was only around 2% of trades. No other customer had more than a $1 billion line of credit and as far as she knew, Alameda's essentially unlimited credit line was never disclosed to customers, auditors, or investors. Yet FTX would market itself as a ""safe"" and ""audited"" exchange. Ellison also testified to Alameda receiving 60–70% of the initial distribution of FTX's native token for free.In 2021, Ellison and Bankman-Fried discussed a ""10th percentile"" scenario—they thought there was a 10% chance of a situation at least this bad materializing. According to Ellison's calculations, if they made another $3 billion in venture investments but also converted their loans with Genesis Digital Assets to fixed term, their overall likelihood of finding themselves unable to repay all of their loans was 3%. Bankman-Fried reportedly then asked Ellison to try to change the Genesis loans to fixed term and said that he still wanted to proceed with the investments. Ellison only managed to convert some of the loans.""For any major decision I would always run them by Sam ... and defer to Sam,"" claimed Ellison. But she did take responsibility for some major decisions. During the crypto crash in June 2022 when third-party lenders started recalling their loans, Alameda was obligated to repay them immediately but its crypto assets had just lost considerable value. Ellison testified that Bankman-Fried had blamed her ""loudly and strongly"" for Alameda's precarious financial position and she admitted that she should have hedged its portfolio as he had suggested, although he had been the one ""who chose to make all the investments"". Additionally, when Bankman-Fried suggested Ellison take on a new co-CEO when her co-CEO left, she rejected the idea and remained Alameda's sole CEO. More generally, she and her co-CEO had taken over a lot of Alameda's day-to-day business in 2020 and by 2021, Ellison testified that Bankman-Fried had largely stopped coming into the Alameda office. She also criticized Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao for his role in the bankruptcy, saying that his ""real aim ... was to hurt FTX and Alameda"".At one point during her testimony, Ellison broke down in tears, remembering her relief when FTX collapsed because she ""didn't have to lie anymore"".During the cross-examination, Ellison admitted to telling prosecutors that Bankman-Fried ""might not know"" about some of the customer funds in Alameda bank accounts and that there were ""periods of time when he wasn't paying attention to Alameda"". She also conceded that Alameda had tried to hire several people to oversee their accounting, but they all left."
895,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Witnesses for the prosecution,Gary Wang,"Gary Wang, a long-time friend of Bankman-Fried's and FTX's former chief technology officer, also has a plea deal with the government and is hoping to serve no jail time. On November 7, 2022, when FTX was facing ""an $8 billion shortfall in customer assets"" and customer withdrawals spiked, Bankman-Fried gave the assurance on Twitter that ""FTX is fine. Assets are fine"" and that they had ""enough to cover all client holdings."" This was not accurate, Wang testified, although under cross-examination he admitted to having previously told prosecutors that it was technically true in virtue of FTX still being solvent, just not liquid. When Bankman-Fried made the decision a few days later to hand over some remaining assets to Bahamian regulators, the alleged motivation was that Bahamian authorities were more open to letting him retain control of FTX than U.S. authorities were.In 2019, Wang had altered FTX's code to allow Alameda to withdraw essentially unlimited funds without being automatically liquidated. While Bankman-Fried never wrote nor reviewed FTX's code himself, Wang testified that he made the change on Bankman-Fried's direction. Wang did, however, concede that this was a necessary part of Alameda providing the exchange with liquidity.Despite Wang claiming that he didn't know if Ellison had properly hedged, the defense was able to highlight a statement made by Bankman-Fried in a September 2022 memo about potentially shutting down Alameda: ""The fact that we didn't hedge as much as we should have alone cost more in EV [expected value] than all the money Alameda had ever made or ever will make, and that's the kind of critical mistake we're likely to make if I'm not actually running the show there."""
896,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Witnesses for the prosecution,Nishad Singh,"Former head of engineering Nishad Singh was the third FTX executive to enter a plea bargain with the prosecution and is also hoping to serve no jail time. He testified that he was unaware of Alameda using customer funds until Wang informed him in September 2022 that Alameda was borrowing $13 billion from FTX. Singh had then requested a meeting with Bankman-Fried in which Singh expressed that he was ""really freaked out"" by Alameda's net asset value (NAV). Bankman-Fried reportedly told Singh that Alameda's NAV was actually ""super positive"" and that while they were ""a little short on deliverables"", he thought Alameda could deliver $5 billion quickly and ""substantially more"" over weeks to months by Alameda selling assets and FTX raising from investors. Singh requested another meeting after Bankman-Fried returned from trying to raise funds in the Middle East. In this meeting, according to Singh, Bankman-Fried still maintained that they could get another $5 billion, but also said that the main way Alameda would be able to return its loans would be through FTX remaining successful.Singh recounted how Bankman-Fried had ""profligately"" spent ""huge sums of money"" on investments, campaign donations, celebrity endorsements, and real estate. Examples shared with the court included $1.5 billion for a bitcoin mining deal with a company in Kazakhstan, $205 million for the naming rights to the arena of the Miami Heat NBA basketball team, and a $30 million apartment for himself and his colleagues to live in. Singh condemned the spending as ""evil"" and reported how he had described one investment as ""value extractive"" to Bankman-Fried. On cross-examination, Singh conceded that he had taken the master bedroom in said $30 million apartment and that he had borrowed $3.7 million from FTX to buy a house after he became aware of the misuse of customer funds. And he acknowledged originally thinking of some of Alameda's privileges on FTX as ""helpful for customers"".Singh also testified to back-dating some transactions in December 2021 to bump FTX's revenue over the $1 billion milestone. Then in November 2022, feeling ""suicidal"" as the crisis intensified, Singh proposed backdating a trade to write off some of his own debt, to which Bankman-Fried replied, ""I think that's probably fine"". The court were shown a message exchange from around the same time in which Singh said to Bankman-Fried, ""this is wildly selfish of me, but [FTX lawyers] may need to know that it wasnt a ton of people orchestrating it. I think it makes them more likely to want to be here to help save the situation and the others at least"". Bankman-Fried is seen replying, ""yup"" followed by ""[for what it's worth] I don't think that's super selfihs [sic], I think that's probably correct""."
897,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Witnesses for the prosecution,Adam Yedidia,"Under an immunity order, FTX software engineer Adam Yedidia reported learning in June 2022 that Alameda owed FTX $8 billion. In the course of fixing a bug in FTX's code that had overstated Alameda's liability by $8 billion, Yedidia noticed that Alameda's remaining liability to FTX was still $8 billion. He testified that he discussed this with Bankman-Fried, although under cross-examination he admitted that the postmortem report he had circulated to Bankman-Fried and others had not specified the size of the liability. But the amount seemed worryingly large to Yedidia, so one day after a game of paddle tennis he asked Bankman-Fried, ""Are we OK?"" to which Bankman-Fried allegedly replied, ""We were bulletproof last year, but we're not bulletproof anymore.""In November, Yedidia ""heard that Alameda Research had used FTX customer profits to pay back its loans to creditors"" and resigned."
898,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Witnesses for the prosecution,Other witnesses,"Other witnesses for the prosecution included FTX customer Marc-Antoine Julliard, FTX general counsel Can Sun, Alameda software engineer Christian Drappi, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince, angel investor Matt Huang, accounting professor Peter Easton, investigative analyst Shamel Medrano, FBI agent Marc Troiano, Eliora Katz, and Cory Gaddis."
899,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Witnesses for the defense,Sam Bankman-Fried,"There was speculation on whether Bankman-Fried would testify, since the restrictions on his prescribed medication for ADHD while in jail ostensibly hindered his ability to ""meaningfully participate"" in the trial. However, on October 27, he took the stand.
Key themes of Bankman-Fried's testimony were that other executives had a lot of decision-making power and that there was some critical information he was not aware of at the time. Many of Alameda's problems stemmed from Ellison's refusal to follow his hedging advice, according to Bankman-Fried, and Wang and Singh were responsible for FTX giving Alameda a practically unlimited line of credit. In general, Bankman-Fried claimed to have only been vaguely familiar with how funds actually moved between FTX and Alameda until it was too late. He also expressed regret, acknowledging that ""a lot of people got hurt"" as a result of his mistakes. All he had wanted to do, he said, was ""build the best product on the market."""
900,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Witnesses for the defense,Other witnesses,"Krystal Rolle is a Bahamas-based attorney who has previously represented Bankman-Fried on non-criminal matters. She testified that the day after FTX declared bankruptcy, Bahamian authorities ordered Bankman-Fried to transfer remaining assets to the Securities Commission of the Bahamas and that he had cooperated. Joseph Pimbley, an expert in financial risk management, testified that most FTX customers had the kind of account that permitted their funds to be lent to other customers."
901,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Witnesses for the defense,Rejected testimony,"Under oath, but without the presence of the jury, Bankman-Fried described how internal lawyers and outside counsel Fenwick & West had been involved in various key decisions at the heart of the case. Judge Kaplan heard that chief regulatory officer Dan Friedberg put together FTX's documentation-retention policy, that formal business communications would take place via channels without auto-deletion, and that in November 2022, Bankman-Fried disabled auto-deletion ""on any place I found it"". Bankman-Fried said that he did not consider Ellison's seven drafts of an Alameda balance sheet to be formal business documentation and that business-related spreadsheets were informally shared with lawyers over Signal. Kaplan was shown that it was Dan Friedberg's name on the application form for the bank account that allowed FTX to use Alameda as a payment processor and Bankman-Fried said Friedberg had been part of discussions about using Alameda to receive customer deposits. Bankman-Fried also explained that since some people did not want venture investments to come directly from Alameda, lawyers had suggested he get a loan from FTX and make the investment himself. He further testified that, on the basis of FTX's terms of service, he had believed that Alameda was allowed to borrow funds in ""many circumstances""; when pressed on his awareness of Alameda's special privileges as an FTX customer, Bankman-Fried conceded only that he had ""believed that it was permissible for there to be borrowing from assets FTX was holding that were acting as security or collateral"". Kaplan decided to reject almost all of this testimony.The first seven witnesses proposed by Bankman-Fried's team were all rejected by Kaplan in September. Among them was English barrister Lawrence Akka, who was to testify that FTX's terms of service ""did not contain a declaration of trust over any fiat currency, but gave rise only to a contractual creditor-debtor relationship"". Kaplan agreed with the prosecution that since Akka would only be offering ""legal opinions as to the meaning of the contract terms at issue"", his testimony would not qualify under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which states that a witness can opine in the courtroom if their expertise can assist in the jury's understanding of matters of fact. Witnesses were also prohibited from testifying about the successful Anthropic investment potentially meaning that FTX customers can be made whole—ostensibly showing Bankman-Fried's investment strategy to be reasonable rather than risky—or Bankman-Fried's charitable donations and philanthropic work."
902,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Closing arguments,,"The prosecution told the jury that FTX was ""a pyramid of deceit built by the defendant on a foundation of lies and false promises, all to get money"", and which left ""countless victims in its wake"" after its collapse. They asserted Bankman-Fried then lied to the jury: ""Did you see on Friday how his testimony was smooth like, it'd been rehearsed a bunch of times?"" The prosecution argued that the verdict rests mainly on how much Bankman-Fried was aware of where customer funds went and whether he thought it was wrong.  The lead prosecutor Nicolas Roos concluded: ""He took the money. He knew it was wrong. He did it anyway, because he thought ... he could walk his way out of it and talk his way out of it. And today, with you, that ends.""""Every movie needs a villain"" was the retort. Defense lawyer Mark Cohen argued that because the prosecution had no real proof, they had resorted to bullying, talking about Bankman-Fried's sex life and appearance in an effort to get the jury to dislike him. Cohen lamented: ""Time and again, the government has sought to turn Sam into some sort of villain, some sort of monster."" He continued: ""In the real world—unlike the movie world—things can get messy. Poor risk management is not a crime."" As for why executives did not take their money and run, and why Bankman-Fried repeatedly ""subject[ed] himself to public questioning"", the defense claimed that no one thought they were ""doing anything wrong"". Cohen also noted something missing from the trial: no one actually testified that Bankman-Fried told them to steal money or commit crimes.As the closing arguments came to an end, Bankman-Fried appeared to be crying."
903,United States v. Bankman-Fried,Verdict,,"The jury began deliberations on November 2 around 3:15 p.m., and ended them after five hours on the same day: Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all charges. The date of his sentencing was announced to be March 28, 2024. After the verdict, Attorney General Merrick Garland said: ""Sam Bankman-Fried thought that he was above the law. Today's verdict proves he was wrong. This case should send a clear message to anyone who tries to hide their crimes behind a shiny new thing they claim no one else is smart enough to understand: the Justice Department will hold you accountable.""According to Reuters, Bankman-Fried will likely appeal; his lawyer said that he intended to ""vigorously fight the charges."""

However, two days prior at Dynamite: Grand Slam, as Cole came out to support MJF in his AEW World Championship match, Cole broke his foot jumping off the entrance ramp. The following week, Better Than You Bay Bay initially announced that they would have to relinquish the ROH World Tag Team Championship, but MJF instead decided that he would defend the title in a handicap match against The Righteous at WrestleDream.After racking up wins and taking out her opponents in post-match attacks, on the September 23 episode of Collision, The House of Black's Brody King announced that Julia Hart wanted to face Kris Statlander for the AEW TBS Championship, and if Statlander did not accept, Hart would continue laying waste to her opponents.

In order to further hurt Omega, Callis and Takeshita announced their new target as Omega's former Golden Lovers tag team partner, Kota Ibushi, with the duo shown to have completed their assault on Ibushi in Japan on the September 27 episode of Dynamite. Subsequently, Callis also began a feud with longtime friend Chris Jericho, where he betrayed Jericho in August. Callis then helped Will Ospreay to defeat Jericho at All In. Following this, Jericho's protege Sammy Guevara betrayed Jericho on September 20 at Dynamite: Grand Slam, defecting to join Callis.

922,"2023 Gary, Indiana, mayoral election",Summary,,"The 2023 Gary, Indiana, mayoral election was held on November 7, 2023, to elect the mayor of Gary, Indiana. Primary elections were held on May 2. Incumbent mayor Jerome Prince ran for re-election to a second term in office, but lost the Democratic primary to state senator Eddie Melton. This election marked the first time in the history of Gary, Indiana, that a one-term mayor was defeated in a reelection bid. Melton defeated Republican nominee Andrew Delano in the general election."
923,"2023 Gary, Indiana, mayoral election",Background,,"Mayoral elections in Gary, Indiana, are partisan. Mayors serve four-year terms, with no term limits. Incumbent mayor Jerome Prince was first elected after defeating two-term mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson in 2019. Prince had been criticized in his first term for the lack of a permanent police chief. His challenger, state senator Eddie Melton, had also criticized him for his ""abortive attempt"" to sell the Genesis Convention Center to a company that later defaulted and was sued by the city.In late January 2023, Prince announced his reelection bid, with Melton and truck driver Danien Walls as his primary opponents. In February 2023, Lake County Democratic Party chair Jim Wieser announced he would be seeking to remove Walls from the ballot, on the grounds that Walls ""had no history of having voted as a Democrat."" In Indiana, in order to appear on a major party's primary ballot, a candidate must have requested for the primary ballot of that party and voted in that party's two prior primary elections, or obtain a waiver from the county party chair. As Walls had not met either condition, the board upheld Wieser's challenge and removed Walls from the ballot.In April 2023, Howey Politics Indiana rated the Democratic primary race as a toss-up. Melton defeated Prince in the primary. This election marked the first time in the history of Gary, Indiana, that a one-term mayor was defeated in a reelection bid, and it also marked the second election in a row where an incumbent mayor was defeated by a challenger.The population of Gary had fallen by 61% from its peak in the 1960s down to only 66,583 residents as of December 2022. Owing to the downward trend in population, the Democratic primary tally of 10,790 votes was 4,000 fewer votes than the Democratic primary in the 2019 mayoral race."

945,2023 Ohio Issue 2,Summary,,"The Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol initiative, listed on the ballot as Issue 2, is a ballot initiative for legalization of cannabis in the U.S. state of Ohio that was passed by voters on November 7, 2023."
946,2023 Ohio Issue 2,History,,"State law in Ohio allows citizens to bring initiatives before the state legislature, with signatures of at least 3 percent of the total vote cast for the office of governor at the last gubernatorial election. These must have been obtained from at least 44 of the 88 counties in Ohio. From each of these 44 counties, there must be signatures equal to at least 1.5 percent of the total vote cast for the office of governor in that county at the last gubernatorial election.Upon meeting these requirements, a group can force the legislature to consider an initiative. Without action from the General Assembly or the Governor, by collecting more signature of a quantity again meeting the above-mentioned requirements, the group can force to send it to voters on the November ballot. In Ohio, a group called the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol brought the initiative to the Ohio Secretary of State to be a 2022 ballot initiative. It was approved on August 30, 2021, for signature gathering. Over 200,000 signatures were submitted to the state at the end of 2021.A lawsuit over filing deadlines resulted in the Ohio Secretary of State and the state legislature agreeing the initiative's signatures collected in 2021 and 2022 may be applied toward a 2023 ballot deadline.In July 2023, on an initial count of valid signatures, supporters came about 650 short. On August 3, more than ten times the remaining number required to validate the initiative for the November ballot were turned in to the secretary of state. On August 16, 2023, the Secretary of State confirmed that the initiative would appear as a referendum ballot on November 7, 2023.The initiative was passed by voters on November 7, 2023."
947,2023 Ohio Issue 2,Provisions,,"Adults age 21 and up may purchase, possess and consume marijuana. Home grow of up to six plants per person or 12 plants per residence is allowed. The Division of Cannabis Control is established within the Ohio Department of Commerce to regulate commerce. Cannabis testing laboratories and supply chain are to be regulated.The initiative also specifies how tax revenues under the new law would be spent. Thirty-six percent (36%) would be designated for ""social equity and jobs"" programs, estimated to be as high as $150 million per year. Thirty-six percent (36%) would go to communities that have dispensaries. Twenty-five percent (25%) would go to education and addiction treatment programs, and 3% would be used for regulatory and administrative costs."
948,2023 Ohio Issue 2,Sponsor,,"The sponsor of the initiative, Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, is an affiliate of Marijuana Policy Project."
949,2023 Ohio Issue 2,Politics,,"Ohio passed medical cannabis (along with decriminalized cannabis) in 2016 under Ohio House Bill 523.In early 2022, pro-cannabis advocates gathered signatures to send recreational legalization measure to the state legislature. In April, the Senate president publicly announced that he would not bring the measure up for a vote. Under Ohio law, advocates now have a second opportunity to gather more signatures, and if they gather enough, the measure will go on the ballot in November. “The recreational cannabis petition collected 136,000 verified signatures, enough to get considered by the General Assembly, but would require an additional 132,877 signatures to proceed to the ballot.”The largest organized opposition comes from the Center for Christian Virtue, which believes legalized cannabis will produce negative impacts on neighborhoods and society's drug addiction problems. The main proponent behind the ballot initiative is the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol (CRMLA), which dismissed the Center for Christian Virtue's opposition as ""Prohibition-style talking points from 20 years ago.""In October 2023, Republican Senate President Matt Huffman warned that state legislators may repeal key provisions of Issue 2 if it passed."

953,2023 Ohio Issue 2,Reaction,,"On November 8, the day after polling, top Republican leaders in Ohio indicated the possibility of overturning the measures approved by the voters in the ballot, along with those of Issue 1 on abortion. Republicans who oppose the initiative are able to change the law and to repeal it due to holding majorities in both the Ohio House of Representatives and the Ohio Senate. Ohio Senate leader Steve Huffman, a Republican, said that given the result, Ohio legislators ""may consider amending the statute to clarify the questionable language regarding limits for THC and tax rates as well as other parts of the statute."" While Issue 2 mandates that marijuana tax revenue should be used to regulate marijuana, support substance abuse services, assist industry business owners and fund local governments where recreational business owners exist, Ohio House leader Jason Stephens, also a Republican, called for the Ohio ""legislature to lead on how best to allocate tax revenues"", and proposed ""county jail construction and funding law enforcement training""."

971,APEC United States 2023,Summary,,"APEC 2023 United States is the year-long hosting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings in the United States taking place in 2023. It is being held in San Francisco. It marks the third time the United States hosts an APEC meeting, having hosted in 1993 in Blake Island and 2011 in Honolulu."
972,APEC United States 2023,Preparations,,"In November 2023, San Francisco started clearing out all of the homeless people from certain parts of the city in preparation for the summit. On September 25, a high-ranking official from the city's Public Works department emailed to city officials listing seven intersections to target, writing that due to the upcoming summit, he was ""concerned about historical encampments that are close to priority areas"". The San Francisco Chronicle noted that ""All seven intersections are in the two neighborhoods that have long been at the epicenter of San Francisco’s unrelenting crises of homelessness and public drug markets."""
973,APEC United States 2023,Events,Participants,"Due to the sanctions imposed on him by the US government, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee was not invited to the summit. In response, the Chinese foreign ministry reiterated its calls for the US to lift sanctions on Lee, and ""fulfil the due responsibility as APEC host, invite Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu to the meeting"". Eventually, the Hong Kong government announced Lee would not attend due to ""scheduling issues"", with Financial Secretary Paul Chan attending in his place. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador initially announced he would not attend the summit due to disagreements with Peruvian President Dina Boluarte. However, he later changed his decision, saying he would attend. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been issued an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, will not attend the summit, with Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Overchuk attending in his place.This is the first APEC meeting for Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, and Vietnamese President Võ Văn Thưởng. While Thưởng is the head of state of Vietnam, the true leader of the country is General Secretary of the Communist Party Nguyễn Phú Trọng, who is not attending the summit.
International coverage focused on the summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on 15 November, held separately from the APEC summit. Xi and Biden met virtually at the meeting hosted by New Zealand in 2021 – the first APEC summit of the Biden presidency – but Vice President Kamala Harris went in Biden's place to Thailand in 2022. (Xi hosted the 2014 summit with U.S. President Barack Obama attending in Beijing). Anticipation in the U.S. for the 2023 meeting by the two leaders preceded the event in San Francisco. Though this is Biden's first in-person APEC meeting after had to go entirely remote in the aforementioned 2021 summit, second overall."

983,2023 United States elections,Summary,,"The 2023 United States elections were held, in large part, on Tuesday, November 7, 2023. The off-year election included gubernatorial and state legislative elections in a few states, as well as numerous citizen initiatives, mayoral races, and a variety of other local offices on the ballot. At least three special elections to the United States Congress were scheduled as either deaths or vacancies arose. The Democratic Party retained control of the governorship in Kentucky, flipped the Wisconsin Supreme Court and held a seat on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, gained six seats in the New Jersey General Assembly, and won back unified control of the Virginia General Assembly, while Republicans also flipped the governorship in Louisiana and narrowly retained Mississippi's governorship. The election cycle also saw Ohio voting to enshrine abortion rights to the state constitution and legalized cannabis. The results were widely seen as a success for the Democratic Party.
The election cycle was generally marked by a trend of strong Democratic over performances in special elections. Daily Kos and FiveThirtyEight analyses of at least 38 races in September 2023 determined that the party outperformed the partisan lean by an average of 10 percent. In comparison, Democrats outperformed by an average of 4 percent in elections held between the 2018 and 2020 elections, and an average of 7.6 percent in elections held in 2020. The 2023 overperformances consisted of unusually larger margins of victory in races held in safely Democratic areas and unusually smaller margins of defeat in races held in safely Republican areas. The results indicate a suburban shift among affluent, college-educated voters that started as an underlying reaction to Donald Trump's election in 2016. While the results were generally in line with predictions, Democrats still outperformed expectations despite the low approval ratings of incumbent Democratic President Joe Biden and polls indicating his middling prospects in the 2024 presidential election.Both Democratic and Republican operatives attributed the Democrats' overperformance streak to general support of broad abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. This marked a continuing trend of bipartisan voter support for ballot initiative on abortion rights since the June 2022 decision. Many conservative political analysts and commentators called a continued Republican alliance with the anti-abortion movement ""untenable"" and an ""electoral disaster"", and urged the party to favor abortion rights. Young voters in particular gave overwhelming support for abortion rights. Among voters between 18 and 29 years old in increasingly Republican Ohio, an estimated 77% voted for Ohio Issue 1, including a majority of Republicans. Exit polling indicated Ohioans believed abortion should be ""mostly legal"" by a margin of 61-36%."
984,2023 United States elections,Federal elections,House of Representatives,"At least three special elections will be or have been held in 2023 to fill vacancies during the 118th U.S. Congress.

Rhode Island's 1st congressional district: Democrat Gabe Amo defeated Republican Gerry Leonard Jr. to succeed David Cicilline, who resigned on May 31, 2023, to become the president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation. The district has a partisan index of D+14.

997,FBI investigation into Eric Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign,Summary,,"In spring 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York began a corruption investigation into alleged straw donors from the government of Turkey through construction company KSK Construction to the 2021 campaign of New York City mayor Eric Adams."
998,FBI investigation into Eric Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign,Background,,"Adams's fundraising efforts have attracted scrutiny. In 2018, real estate developer David Schwartz met with Adams, then-borough president of Brooklyn, and donated to his campaign. Adams endorsed zoning changes sought by Slate Property Group, Schwartz's company, to construct a skyscraper taller than as allowed by zoning laws. In May 2021, employees of the Brooklyn construction firm KSK Construction donated a total of US$14,000 to Adams's mayoral campaign, allowing the campaign to qualify for US$18,000 in public matching funds. According to Politico, of the firm's eleven employees, ten had not made a prior political donation; co-owner Erden Arkan last donated to former Brooklyn borough president Marty Markowitz's campaign in 2009.Adams has boasted his support for Turkey, stating that no other mayor in New York City history had visited the country as much as he did. In August 2015, the consulate-general of Turkey paid for Adams's trip to the country. After securing the Democratic mayoral primary in July, Adams urged then-fire commissioner Daniel A. Nigro to allow the government of Turkey to occupy the Turkish House; the New York City Fire Department declined to sign off on the building, citing fire safety issues. During his borough presidency, Adams met with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan."

Adams denied the accusations at a press conference at New York City Hall press conference the following week, disclosing that he had retained the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr.Following a report from The New York Times that Adams was being investigated over the construction of the Turkish House, Adams further denied wrongdoing and assured that he would continue to cooperate with investigators. Adams and the City Hall's chief counsel requested the Federal Bureau of Investigation cease leaks of its investigation."
1001,FBI investigation into Eric Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign,Reactions,Democratic Party,Brooklyn Democratic Party chairwoman Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn questioned if the inquiry was related to Adams' race. State senator Leroy Comrie called the investigation a witch hunt.
1002,FBI investigation into Eric Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign,Reactions,Republican Party,"Representative Brandon Williams criticized the investigation as a ""weaponization of the justice system"" against Adams' critical comments towards president Joe Biden.

Additionally, she also announced a ""Lucha Rules"" tag team match in conjunction with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), where MLW World Middleweight Champion Rocky Romero will team with Bárbaro Cavernario to face potential middleweight contender Ichiban and Máscara Dorada.For the past several months, The Second Gear Crew (Mance Warner, Matthew Justice, and 1 Called Manders) have been feuding with Mister Saint Laurent's World Titan Federation, ever since MSL betrayed his former client Microman and aligned with Davey Boy Smith Jr.. At Fury Road, Warner faced MSL's newest client Matt Cardona in a No Holds Barred Kiss My Foot match in a losing effort. He was then forced to kiss MSL's foot rather than Cardona's, but instead bit the foot of MSL in retaliation. On November 1, MLW announced a rematch between Warner and Cardona, this time in a Loser Leaves MLW match.The World Titan Federation also recently began a feud with Alex Kane's Bomaye Fight Club, stemming from Slaughterhouse where Matt Cardona interrupted Kane after he had retained over Tom Lawlor (a substitute for Davey Boy Smith Jr. who was pulled from the show for emergency surgery). Lawlor then attacked Kane and his BFC teammates (Mr. Thomas and O'Shay Edwards) before confirming his alignment with the WTF. On October 31, MLW announced a tag team match for the Fusion taping, where Thomas and Edwards will face Lawlor and a new mystery member of the WTF.In the ongoing feud between the Second Gear Crew and The Caliing, The SGC's Matthew Justice and 1 Called Manders challenged The Calling's Akira and Rickey Shane Page for the MLW World Tag Team Championship in a tables match. However, that ended in a no contest when Justice and Akira went through a stack of tables at the same time. The two teams continued to brawl afterward, with Mance Warner and The Calling's minions joining in. The SGC would challenge The Calling to a ladder match for the titles at Fightland, which was accepted and made official by MLW on November 6."

1008,Full Gear (2023),Summary,,"The 2023 Full Gear was the fifth annual Full Gear professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It took place on Saturday, November 18, 2023, at the Kia Forum in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood, California.

In other prominent matches, ""Timeless"" Toni Storm defeated Hikaru Shida to win her record-tying third AEW Women's World Championship and Swerve Strickland defeated ""Hangman"" Adam Page in a Texas Death match.
The event was also notable for Will Ospreay officially signing with AEW, although his contact with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) expires in February 2024."
1009,Full Gear (2023),Production,Background,"Full Gear is a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event held annually in November by All Elite Wrestling (AEW) since 2019, generally around the week of Veterans Day. It is one of AEW's ""Big Four"" PPVs, which includes Double or Nothing, All Out, and Revolution, their four biggest events produced quarterly. Out of the four, Full Gear is AEW's only pay-per-view to be traditionally held on a Saturday. During the All In post-event media scrum on August 27, 2023, it was announced that the fifth Full Gear event would take place on November 18, 2023, at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California. Tickets went on sale on September 8, 2023. AEW also partnered with Joe Hand Promotions to air Full Gear in select theaters across the United States and in select out-of-home establishments (e.g., restaurants) across North America.Due to the event taking place in Collision's normal Saturday night time slot, that weekend's episode was instead held live at the same venue the night before on Friday, November 17 at 8 p.m. Eastern Time (ET)—Collision is AEW's third weekly program that launched in June. This did not affect AEW's regular Friday program, Rampage, which also aired live that same night from the same venue at its normal 10 p.m. ET slot."
1010,Full Gear (2023),Production,Storylines,"Full Gear featured professional wrestling matches that were the result of pre-existing feuds and storylines, with results being predetermined by AEW's writers. Storylines were produced on AEW's weekly television programs, Dynamite, Collision, and Rampage.
On the September 27 episode of Dynamite, Jay White interrupted AEW World Champion MJF. White claimed that he was ultimately responsible for MJF and Adam Cole's friendship and subsequent teaming as Better Than You Bay Bay, as Cole had gotten injured in their match at the 2022 Forbidden Door, with Cole becoming involved with MJF after returning the following year. White then claimed that he would take the AEW World Championship from MJF. The following week, White, along with Bullet Club Gold stablemates Juice Robinson and The Gunns (Austin Gunn and Colten Gunn), attacked MJF. White subsequently stole the AEW World Championship belt and challenged MJF for the title at Full Gear and MJF accepted. Additionally, on the October 24 episode, The Gunns stated they wanted a match against MJF for the ROH World Tag Team Championship at Full Gear, which MJF accepted. On October 30, it was announced that MJF and a mystery partner would defend the tag title against The Gunns during the Full Gear Zero Hour pre-show—MJF's championship partner Cole suffered a broken foot in late September. Samoa Joe offered to be his partner in exchange for a future AEW World Championship match, but MJF declined until the November 17 episode of Rampage when he accepted after Joe saved him from a beat down.At WrestleDream, Christian Cage defeated Darby Allin to retain the AEW TNT Championship, which also saw Nick Wayne turn on Allin and join with Cage. Following the match, Cage and Wayne attacked Allin further until Sting came out to make the save, but Luchasaurus also got involved to attack Sting and Allin. As Cage was about to perform a con-chair-to on Sting, Adam Copeland (formerly known as Edge in WWE) made his AEW debut and saved Sting and Allin. On the following Dynamite, Copeland tried to bring Cage to his senses and reunite as a team, but Cage refused. On the October 24 episode, Cage, Luchasaurus, and Wayne interrupted Sting and challenged him, Allin, and a partner of their choosing to a six-man tag team match at Full Gear, which Sting accepted. Later during a backstage interview, Copeland said he refused to fight Cage, but then Sting and Allin appeared and told him that Cage could not be trusted. The following week, after Cage, Luchasaurus, and Wayne attacked Copeland, he was saved by Sting and Allin. Copeland then stated he would be their partner at Full Gear. Cage's faction would later be known as The Patriarchy.At All Out, Jon Moxley defeated Orange Cassidy to win the AEW International Championship. However, at Dynamite: Grand Slam, Moxley dropped the title to Rey Fenix due to a legitimate concussion incurred during the match. Cassidy then regained the title from Fenix at Dynamite: Title Tuesday. After Cassidy retained the title against Moxley's Blackpool Combat Club stablemate Claudio Castagnoli on the November 1 episode, Moxley came to the ring and was attacked by Cassidy. Later, Moxley challenged Cassidy for the International Championship at Full Gear, which was later confirmed."

Adam Cole then made his return and distracted Austin, allowing Joe to lock in the Coquina Clutch on Colten, forcing Austin to submit. After the match, MJF hugged Cole, but then The Gunns attacked MJF with a chair and slammed chairs on his leg multiple times. MJF was then carried out on a stretcher and into an ambulance, thus MJF was deemed unable to face Jay White for the AEW World Championship in the main event of Full Gear. Cole then said that he would defend the title on behalf of MJF."

1039,2023 Kentucky gubernatorial election,Summary,,"The 2023 Kentucky gubernatorial election was held on November 7, 2023, to elect the governor and lieutenant governor of Kentucky. Incumbent Governor Andy Beshear won re-election to a second term, defeating Republican State Attorney General Daniel Cameron. Had Cameron won, he would have become Kentucky's first African American governor.
This race was one of two Democratic-held governorships up for election in 2023 in a state Donald Trump won in 2020. The other was held in Louisiana, which Republicans successfully flipped.
This was the first gubernational election in the state's history where both major party candidates have previously held the position of Attorney General; Beshear held the position from 2016 to 2019, after which he was succeeded by Cameron.
Beshear's victory has been attributed to his broad popularity among Democrats and Independents as well as approximately half of Kentucky Republicans. Compared to his election in 2019, Beshear most improved his performance in suburban precincts: he increased his margins by nearly 6 percentage points in suburban areas, compared to just 4.5 percentage points in urban and rural precincts."
1040,2023 Kentucky gubernatorial election,Background,,"A socially conservative southern state, Kentucky is considered safely Republican in federal elections, with Republicans holding both of its U.S. Senate seats and all but one U.S. House seat. In the 2020 presidential election, Republican Donald Trump carried Kentucky by 26 percentage points. However, the state was much more competitive as recently as the 1990s (Bill Clinton, a Democrat, carried it twice at the presidential level), and Democrats remain competitive in many local and some state-level elections.
Beshear was first elected in 2019, narrowly defeating incumbent Republican Matt Bevin, who had been saddled with low approval ratings and heavy criticism for signing a pension reform bill for teachers. In that same year, Daniel Cameron was elected Attorney General of Kentucky, becoming the first African-American to be elected to that position.
Since his election to Attorney General, Cameron had gained national recognition, especially due to his involvement in the Breonna Taylor case in 2020. He spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention on August 25, 2020. In September 2020, Cameron appeared on a 20-person shortlist of potential U.S. Supreme Court nominees by President Trump.On May 16, 2023, Cameron won the Republican nomination with 47.7% of the vote, a 26% margin over the second-place candidate."

1055,2023 Kentucky gubernatorial election,General election,Results,"Beshear won reelection by a comfortable margin. Key to his victory was his performance in the state's two largest counties, Jefferson and Fayette (home to the cities of Louisville and Lexington, respectively), each of which he carried with more than 70% of the vote. Beshear also over-performed in several suburban counties in the north-central part of the state, and several historically-Democratic rural counties in the Eastern Coalfield which have in recent years voted Republican in most elections by overwhelming margins.For instance, Beshear carried Breathitt County, which had in 2020 voted Republican by 52 percentage points, by a 22-point margin. In Perry County, which had voted Republican in the 2020 presidential election by 54 percentage points, Beshear prevailed by a 14-point margin, despite himself losing the county to Matt Bevin by a 9-point margin four years prior. In Letcher County, which had voted Republican in 2020 by 60 percentage points and against Beshear in 2019 by 8 points, the incumbent eked out a 4-point win.Cameron failed to take advantage of Republican success down the ballot, as all other offices saw Republican victories. Notably, Kentucky Secretary of State, Michael Adams, created an ad that appeared to avoid getting involved with the top of the ticket. The ad stated that after voters filled out their ballots for governor, they should vote him for secretary of state, not directing voters to vote for fellow Republican Cameron, even showing a photo of him shaking hands with Beshear."

1058,Killing of Paul Kessler,Summary,,"Paul Kessler was a Jewish man who died at the age of 69 after being fatally injured in an altercation on November 5, 2023, between dueling pro-Israel and pro-Palestine demonstrations in Thousand Oaks, California, United States. Kessler's death has been ruled a homicide and authorities have not ruled out the possibility of a hate crime. On  November 16, suspect Loay Alnaji was taken into custody on a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the death of Kessler."
1059,Killing of Paul Kessler,Victim,,"Kessler grew up in the tight-knit Jewish community of Scranton, Pennsylvania. He was known as an ardent Democrat who was passionate about progressive causes and Israel."
1060,Killing of Paul Kessler,Incident,,"At dueling pro-Israel and pro-Palestine demonstrations on the 2023 Israel–Hamas war in Thousand Oaks on November 5, 2023. About seventy-five to a hundred people were gathered at the intersection for the two protests, which were held by two groups; ""Freedom for Palestine"" and ""We are Pro-Israel"". Police patrolling the area reported seeing no indication of violence about fifteen minutes before the altercation reportedly happened. Kessler and a pro-Palestinian supporter had reportedly been involved in an altercation, and Kessler had at some point fallen backwards and hit his head on the ground. Reports of Kessler being struck by a pro-Palestinian supporter in the face with a megaphone were reported, but Ventura County Sherriff Jim Fryoff indicated in a later conference it was unconfirmed.At around 3:20PM responding deputies and EMS responded to calls and found Kessler on the ground conscious  and able to speak. A 50-year-old male pro-Palestinian supporter stayed at the location until deputies arrived to indicate his involvement and had helped Kessler and called 911 after he fell. Bleeding from the head and mouth, Kessler was transported to the hospital, where he was responsive and conscious to speak with law enforcement at the hospital. He died early the next day, November 6, at the hospital."
1061,Killing of Paul Kessler,Investigation,,"Ventura County Sheriff's Office initially stated on November 7 at a news conference that there were conflicting accounts from eyewitnesses about the events leading to Kessler's death, and urged anyone with information to come forward. Sheriff Fryhoff indicated that surveillance footage and other media collected at the scene did not provide a clear view of the encounter and many witnesses disagreed on things such as what caused the fall and who began the conflict.Ventura County Sheriff's Office deputies detained a suspect in Kessler's death, who had remained on the scene after calling 911, answering officers' questions. The sheriff's office released the suspect after questioning, then later searched his home. The medical examiner ruled the cause of death to be homicide, and noted non-lethal facial injuries that could have resulted from being hit. On November 16, the Sheriff's Office announced that they had arrested a 50-year-old male suspect Loay Alnaji in connection to Kessler's death on the charge of involuntary manslaughter with a $1 million bail. The investigation has been handed to the Ventura County District Attorney's Office and a charging decision is expected later on November 16. Alnaji is a professor of computer science at Moorpark College. He has expressed pro-Palestinian views on social media."

1096,March for Israel,Summary,,"The March for Israel was a pro-Israel demonstration that took place at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on November 14, 2023. The rally was organized by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations (CoP) and the Jewish Federations of North America in solidarity with Israel during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war.The media reported an attendance of ""tens of thousands"" and up to 100,000 people, while the event organizers claimed an attendance of 200,000 people. William Daroff, CoP CEO, was also quoted as claiming that 290,000 people attended.
The stated goals of the rally were to support Israel, call for the release of hostages taken by Hamas, and to combat antisemitism. The event was criticized for the attendance of John Hagee, an evangelical pastor known for his controversial views."
1097,March for Israel,Background,,"The 2023 Israel–Hamas war has sparked numerous protests, demonstrations, and vigils across the world. The protests have focused on a variety of issues related to the conflict and have been held on varying scales since the October 7 Hamas attacks.According to March for Israel website, the rally had three main objectives. In addition to standing in support of Israel, the other two goals were to raise awareness for and demand the release of the more than 240 hostages still being held by Hamas after over a month since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The rally was also aimed at condemning rising antisemitism following the October 7 Hamas attack and the start of the war, which the Anti-Defamation League has said rose 388 percent in the U.S. since October 6, 2023, including a 164 percent rise in New York City according to the New York City Police Department and a 140 percent increase in Los Angeles according to the Los Angeles Police Department.On 4 November, 100,000 to 300,000 people participated in the National March on Washington: Free Palestine, marking the largest Palestine solidarity protest in U.S. history. The march called for a ceasefire in Gaza, with many protestors describing the deaths of Palestinians a ""genocide"". It was organized by A.N.S.W.E.R., People's Forum, Students for Justice in Palestine, and other organizations, and saw support from over 450 organizations, including Democratic Socialists of America, Jewish Voice for Peace, IfNotNow, and the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights."
1098,March for Israel,Attendees and speakers,Criticism of John Hagee's attendance,"John Hagee's presence at the demonstration was heavily criticized, including by organisations such the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, the Council on American–Islamic Relations, J Street, and IfNotNow. Writing in MSNBC, Emily Tamkin highlighted how Hagee had previously stated that Adolf Hitler was sent by God to carry out the Holocaust to ""help Jews reach the promised land"".Congresswoman Summer Lee wrote: ""I'm deeply concerned that members of both parties shared a stage yesterday with noted antisemitic bigot John Hagee. This must be condemned."" The Council on American-Islamic Relations said that Hagee had a history of ""Islamophobia and antisemitism"" and should not have been invited to speak, arguing it was hypocritical to invite Hagee while criticising pro-Palestinian marches of being antisemitic."
1099,2023 Mississippi gubernatorial election,Summary,,"The 2023 Mississippi gubernatorial election was held on November 7, 2023, to elect the governor of Mississippi. Incumbent Republican governor Tate Reeves won re-election to a second term, defeating Democratic nominee Brandon Presley. Primary elections were held on August 8. Incumbent Governor Reeves won the Republican nomination, while Presley won the Democratic nomination unopposed. 
This was the best performance for a Democrat, the worst for a Republican, and the closest election since 1999. It was also the closest gubernatorial election won by a Republican since 1991. This was the closest gubernatorial election in the 2023 cycle."
1100,2023 Mississippi gubernatorial election,Background,,"This was the first Mississippi gubernatorial election since a 2020 referendum altered the election process. Previously, under a provision crafted as part of the 1890 Constitution of Mississippi, a candidate needed a majority of voters across the state and a majority of voters in a majority of state House of Representatives districts; if no candidates achieved such a result, the state House of Representatives would choose between the top two finishers, something that last happened in 1999.
This structure was referred to as Mississippi’s version of the electoral college; it was originally crafted, in the words of the Mississippi Historical Society, as part of ""the legal basis and bulwark of the design of white supremacy"". In the 21st century, because the state House districts have been drawn to favor Republican candidates, the provision was seen as helping Republican gubernatorial candidates as well. Under the new law, any candidate who receives a majority of statewide votes will be elected; if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, a statewide runoff election between the top two candidates will be held.A socially conservative Southern state, Mississippi is considered safely Republican at the federal and state level, with both of its U.S. senators, all but one of its U.S. representatives and all statewide officers currently belonging to the Republican Party. In the 2020 presidential election, Donald Trump comfortably carried Mississippi by 17 percentage points. Incumbent governor Tate Reeves was first elected in 2019, narrowly defeating then-attorney general Jim Hood, who was the only Democrat elected to hold statewide office in Mississippi at the time.
Most analysts considered Reeves to be a favorite to win reelection, given the state's partisan lean. Nonetheless, some considered the race to have the potential to become competitive, citing factors such as Reeves' narrow victory four years prior and the heavy criticism he has faced for his handling of the Jackson water crisis and for his ties to a welfare corruption scandal, both of which led him to have the lowest approval ratings of any Republican governor in the country. The Democratic nominee, Brandon Presley, was considered to be a potentially strong general election candidate; he represented the Northern district on the Mississippi Public Service Commission since 2008, despite that district having a strong Republican bent, and held relatively moderate views on social issues, thus being closer to fitting the state."

1290,November 2023 Ohio Issue 1,Summary,,"The 2023 Ohio reproductive rights initiative, officially titled ""The Right to Reproductive Freedom with Protections for Health and Safety"", and listed on the ballot as Issue 1, was a citizen-initiated constitutional amendment that was adopted on November 7, 2023, by a majority of 56.6% of voters. It codified reproductive rights in the Ohio Constitution, including contraception, fertility treatment, whether to continue one's own pregnancy, and miscarriage care, restoring Roe v. Wade-era access in Ohio and protecting ""the right to abortion up to the point of fetal viability"" while permitting restrictions after.In 2019 the Ohio legislature passed a near-total ban on abortion, without exceptions for the health of the mother, rape, incest, or minors. This statute became active after Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. During the time it was in place, multiple children fled the state for abortions after being raped. One of these cases involved a ten-year-old girl from Columbus, Ohio who traveled to Indiana to get the procedure, generating nationwide attention and becoming a central campaign issue. A state court put the ban on hold while a challenge alleging it violated the Ohio Constitution was heard. Issue 1 was seen as determining whether Ohio's statute would remain; several members of the ""no"" campaign had called for bans on forms of birth control that prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg and in vitro fertilization if it fails.The ""yes"" campaign drew support from Ohio medical organizations, doctors, economists, trade unions, editorial boards, reproductive rights groups, and several religious organizations. They argued that a ""yes"" vote would further limited government, protect bodily autonomy and religious liberty, while preventing interference with patient-physician privacy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology, alongside other professional associations of doctors, campaigned for Issue 1. In late August 2023, former President Donald Trump, who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices that voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, condemned six-week abortion bans, including Ohio's, as going ""too far"" and a ""terrible thing and terrible mistake"". Religious groups were generally divided on the issue.Ohio is a socially conservative state; Donald Trump easily won the Buckeye State over Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, so the results of the referendum were widely expected to be a bellwether on whether there is a unified American consensus on abortion rights; voters have supported the ""pro-choice"" side along both bipartisan and overwhelming margins in referendums conducted since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. Polling has indicated that Republican voters have become significantly more supportive of legalized abortion since the 2016 presidential election. Analysts attributed this to Donald Trump's influence and an ongoing realignment within the party on social issues, with Republican voters increasingly placing emphasis on issues such as political correctness rather than Christian right positions on issues such as abortion.The result of the referendum was widely seen as establishing a national consensus in favor of broad abortion rights, marking a continued trend in ballot measures since the Dobbs decision. Among those between 18 and 24 years old, an estimated 76% voted for Issue 1. Many conservative political analysts and commentators called a continued alliance with the anti-abortion movement ""untenable"" and an ""electoral disaster"", and urged the party to adopt a more pro-choice stance on the issue. Exit polling indicated that 61-36% of Ohioans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.One day after the referendum, several far-right state legislators proposed stripping the Ohio Supreme Court of judicial review surrounding the issue, instituting minority rule on abortion within the state. If adopted, the proposals would likely generate a constitutional crisis in the state, and are widely considered by legal scholars to be illegal."
1291,November 2023 Ohio Issue 1,Text,,"Be it Resolved by the People of the State of Ohio that Article I of the Ohio Constitution is amended to add the following Section:
Article I, Section 22. The Right to Reproductive Freedom with Protections for Health and Safety
A. Every individual has a right to make and carry out one's own reproductive decisions, including but not limited to decisions on:

contraception;
fertility treatment;
continuing one's own pregnancy;
miscarriage care; and
abortionB. The State shall not, directly or indirectly, burden, penalize, prohibit, interfere with, or discriminate against either:

An individual's voluntary exercise of this right or
A person or entity that assists an individual exercising this rightunless the State demonstrates that it is using the least restrictive means to advance the individual's health in accordance with widely accepted and evidence-based standards of care.
However, abortion may be prohibited after fetal viability. But in no case may such an abortion be prohibited if in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient's treating physician it is necessary to protect the pregnant patient's life or health.
C. As used in this Section:

""Fetal viability"" means ""the point in a pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient's treating physician, the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus with reasonable measures. This is determined on a case-by-case basis.""
""State"" includes any governmental entity and any political subdivision.D. This Section is self-executing."
1292,November 2023 Ohio Issue 1,Background,2022 Ohio child-rape and Indiana abortion case,"In 2019 the Ohio legislature passed a near-total ban on abortion, without exceptions for the health of the mother, rape, incest, or minors. 
This current statute became briefly active after Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states, including Ohio, to impose unlimited limitations on abortion access. During the time it was in place, multiple children fled the state for abortions after being raped. The most notable case involved a ten-year-old girl from Columbus, Ohio, United States, who traveled to Indiana on June 30, 2022, to get an abortion because current statutory law in Ohio does not provide an exception those who became pregnant because of rape. Her case drew national attention and commentary from public figures, due in part to its proximity to the June 24, 2022, decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Dobbs.Her rapist was arrested by July 13. Before this arrest was made public, Ohio politicians who oppose legal abortion access called the story a hoax; Ohio's attorney general Dave Yost said, ""Every day that goes by, the more likely that this is a fabrication."" After news of the arrest validated the Star's story, these sources did not apologize for claiming the story was a hoax. Jim Bopp, the general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee, said in an interview that the girl should have been forced to bear the child under law, and that ""She would have had the baby, and as many women who have had babies as a result of rape, we would hope that she would understand the reason and ultimately the benefit of having the child."" In September 2022, shortly after Ohio's 6-week abortion ban went into effect, a woman made national news when she almost bled to death after an Ohio hospital refused to treat her miscarriage. Presently, ""a state court put the ban on hold again while a challenge alleging it violates the state constitution plays out""."
1293,November 2023 Ohio Issue 1,Background,Ballot measure submission,"On February 21, 2023, Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom, the group leading support for the initiative, filed the amendment's language with the office of Ohio Attorney General, Dave Yost, who certified it on March 2, sending it to the Ohio Ballot Board, who further certified the proposed amendment on March 13, permitting supporters to begin collecting signatures. On July 5, supporters filed 709,786 signatures, nearly 300,000 more than the minimum number required. Ohio Secretary of State, Frank LaRose, certified the petition on July 25, 2023, after certifying 495,938 valid signatures, more than the approximately 410,000 required."
1294,November 2023 Ohio Issue 1,Background,Attempt to change threshold,"The Ohio Republican Party tried to thwart this constitutional amendment by attempting to change the rules so as to increase to 60% the threshold required for referendum passage in an August 8 special election, known as August 2023 Ohio Issue 1. The voters of Ohio rejected this change 57%-43%, keeping the threshold for passage at 50%+1."
1295,November 2023 Ohio Issue 1,Background,Ballot challenge rejected,On August 11 the Ohio Supreme Court unanimously rejected a lawsuit filed July 28 that would keep the initiative off the ballot.

1301,November 2023 Ohio Issue 1,Reaction,,"Within a day of the close of polling, Ohio's top Republican leaders, who preside over majorities, suggested that action would be taken against the new abortion rights granted by Issue 1. Ohio Republican House Speaker Jason Stephens said that Issue 1 is ""not the end of the conversation"" because there are ""multiple paths that we will explore to continue to protect innocent life."" A spokesperson for Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman reacted to the result: ""This isn't the end. It is really just the beginning of a revolving door of ballot campaigns to repeal or replace Issue 1"".Two days after the result, Ohio State Representatives Jennifer Gross, Bill Dean, Melanie Miller, and Beth Lear, all Republicans, released a statement calling Issue 1 ""deceptive"", declaring that ""Ohio legislators will consider removing jurisdiction from the judiciary over this ambiguous ballot initiative"" so that only Ohio legislators can ""consider what, if any, modifications to make to existing laws"", instead of Ohio courts.Rick Santorum, a Republican and former U.S. Senator, commented on the result of Issue 1 and a simultaneous Ohio voter ballot measure successfully legalising recreational marijuana: ""You put very sexy things like abortion and marijuana on the ballot, and a lot of young people come out and vote. It was a secret sauce for disaster in Ohio … pure democracies are not the way to run a country."" Conservative commentator Sean Hannity urged Republicans to adopt a ""safe, legal, and rare"" framework on abortion.According to Jessie Hill, professor and associate dean at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, the only way the Issue 1 amendment could be challenged is if there were a change to federal law regarding abortion or if another Ohio constitutional amendment restricting abortion was passed, which would mean another election that over 50% of Ohio voters would need to approve."

1303,2023 Rhode Island's 1st congressional district special election,Summary,,"The 2023 Rhode Island's 1st congressional district special election was held on November 7, 2023. The seat became vacant following incumbent Democratic representative David Cicilline's resignation on May 31, 2023, to become the president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation. This was the first congressional special election in Rhode Island since the 1967 2nd district special election and the first special election in the 1st district since 1935.
The 1st district typically elects Democrats. Cicilline was re-elected with 64.0% of the vote in 2022, while Joe Biden won the district with 63.8% of the vote in 2020. The last time a Republican was elected to represent the 1st district was in 1992, when Ronald Machtley won re-election for a third term. Gabe Amo became the first African American to represent Rhode Island in Congress following the election. Amo has worked in different governmental roles, most recently working in the Biden administration in the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. Leonard served in the U.S. Marine Corps for more than 30 years, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait and Somalia."

1321,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Summary,,"From July 14 to November 9, 2023, the American actors' union SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) was on strike over a labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).  As the longest strike in SAG-AFTRA history, its combined impact with the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike resulted in the loss of 45,000 jobs, and ""an estimated $6.5 billion"" loss to the economy of Southern California. According to Deadline Hollywood, the ""harshest pain"" was ""perhaps felt among the below-the-line workers who've had to sell or mortgage their homes, and wipe through IRAs to survive.""Along with the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike (which ended on September 27, 2023), it was part of a series of broader Hollywood labor disputes. Both the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes contributed to the biggest interruption to the American film and television industries since the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 just three years prior. In addition to standing in solidarity with the writers, the strike was led by changes in the industry caused by streaming and its effect on residuals, as well as other new technologies like AI and digital recreation. It marked the first time that actors initiated a labor dispute in the U.S. since the 1980 actors strike and the first time that actors and writers have walked out simultaneously since 1960.
Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP took place from October 2 to October 11, and resumed on October 24. On November 8, 2023, a tentative deal between the two sides was reached. Striking ended on November 9 at 12:01 a.m. PST."
1322,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Background,Unionization in Hollywood,"The Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) is a labor union that represents approximately 160,000 media professionals and entertainers. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) trade association represents film and television studios in collective bargaining negotiations with unions such as SAG-AFTRA, the Directors Guild of America (DGA), and Writers Guild of America, East and Writers Guild of America West, comprising the Writers Guild of America (WGA). SAG-AFTRA was formed by the merger of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) in March 2012, allowing SAG-AFTRA to represent not only actors, but also journalists, talk show hosts, and other broadcast workers. The WGA and the Screen Actors Guild have not simultaneously been on strike since 1960, when actors joined striking writers over residual payments from films sold to television networks. The 1980 actors strike involved the combined efforts of SAG and AFTRA. The largest SAG-AFTRA strike since 1980 occurred in 2000, in which commercial actors went on strike to push for a continuation of the residual system against advertiser backlash, amidst the divisions between SAG and AFTRA.During the last decade and the rise of streaming, writers and actors have been frustrated over studio policy regarding residuals from streaming services; the decline of network television has led to a stronger reliance on other residuals. The 2007–08 WGA strike was motivated in large part by studio executives insisting that writers should receive no residuals from streaming services. The 2007–08 strike cost the city of Los Angeles an estimated US$1.5 billion, according to NPR. As with striking WGA writers, actors have expressed concerns about the use of artificial intelligence, noting that it could be used to replicate their likeness without compensation."
1323,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Background,Pre-strike activity,"Weeks after the Writers Guild of America went on strike in May 2023, SAG-AFTRA's national board of directors unanimously agreed to pursue a strike authorization vote ahead of a renewed contract; SAG-AFTRA approved a new contract in 2020 that would expire on June 30, 2023. The union stated that it did not intend to strike but that it sought to give its negotiators ""maximum bargaining leverage"" ahead of negotiations on June 7, 2023. SAG-AFTRA cited several issues in negotiations, including ""economic fairness, residuals, regulating the use of artificial intelligence and alleviating the burdens of the industry-wide shift to self-taping"", and told its members that the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers would cut actors' salaries to ""pad corporate profits"". In a video released on May 30, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jean Smart, and Kumail Nanjiani appealed to members to vote to strike but reserved that a vote for strike authorization was solely a bargaining tool, not a vote to order an immediate strike.On June 5, 2023, SAG-AFTRA approved the strike authorization by a 98% margin, according to the union. High-profile members—including Quinta Brunson, Jennifer Lawrence, and Rami Malek—signaled their willingness to strike ahead of the deadline to achieve a ""transformative deal"", despite ""extremely productive"" negotiations. SAG-AFTRA agreed to extend negotiations to midnight on July 13, 2023, in an attempt to avoid a strike, but negotiations broke down in July 2023. SAG-AFTRA surveyed members on a strike on July 5, 2023 and began preparing picket signs two days later.The AMPTP agreed to a ""last-minute request"" for mediation from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service on July 11, 2023; congressional and public affairs director Greg Raelson stated that a federal mediator would be present the following day. In turn, SAG-AFTRA accused the AMPTP of attempting to extend negotiations beyond the deadline and reiterated that it would not continue negotiating after July 12, 2023. A number of high-profile actors, including Lawrence and Malek, then affirmed their support again by signing a letter urging the union to take aggressive measures and stating their willingness to strike. It was later reported by Variety that mediation collapsed after AMPTP President Carol Lombardini insulted negotiators by telling them to ""be civilized"" and avert a strike, which prompted a walkout by union negotiators. In response to Lombardini's comment, SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher reportedly said to AMPTP negotiators ""Now you've got two unions on strike"" as they left.On July 12, a statement was made announcing the construction of a Fast & Furious-themed roller coaster; the date of the announcement coincided with the deadline SAG-AFTRA gave before ending negotiations with the AMPTP, and construction began by the strike's start. This added to the construction that began on May 8, shortly after the WGA began protesting on-site, obstructing Lankershim Boulevard along the west end of the park's campus and parking lot and further restricting sidewalk access. The sidewalks in front of Gates 1, 2, 4, and 5 would be scaffolded-off and demolished in this construction. Despite prior advice from the Los Angeles Police Department's Labor Relations Unit to place K-rails from River Road to Universal Hollywood Drive for the safety of protesters and other pedestrians since WGA protests as early as June 6, none were placed by July 18, by which time reports of two protesters being struck by vehicles had been made.
On July 13, with no agreement between SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee voted unanimously to recommend a strike to the union's national board. The national board held a vote officially approving the strike. SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher announced the strike would begin at midnight on July 14; the cast of Oppenheimer left the film's London premiere ahead of the announcement to walk out. Joined by chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Drescher asserted that the strike was a reluctant last resort and described the proposed contract as ""moving around furniture on the Titanic."" In the press conference, Crabtree-Ireland alleged that the AMPTP attempted to include a proposal that allowed studios to, for a one-time fee equivalent to one day's pay, have exclusive and indefinite rights to extras' likenesses, including the use of generative AI to replicate them on screen. Media commentators likened this to the film The Congress (2013) and the Black Mirror sixth series episode ""Joan Is Awful"" (2023). However, AMPTP denied these claims, stating that their proposal would allow usage of these replicas within the specific film for which they are employed, and that any other uses would require consent and further compensation."
1324,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Jul-23,"The strike officially began on July 14. As part of the rules established on July 10, actors cannot engage in film or television productions and cannot take part in promotional work, such as press junkets, film premieres, and events—including San Diego Comic-Con, which was scheduled for July 20–23. The strike action does not apply to SAG-AFTRA members who work under contracts that are negotiated by the union separately from the AMPTP contract, including broadcast journalists. Work in podcasts, ""micro-budget"" independent films, and student films is allowed, as is ""unscripted"" television work such as game shows, reality competition shows, documentaries, and talk shows. Internationally, SAG-AFTRA members are authorized to continue work in the United Kingdom under pre-established Equity collective bargaining agreements, as UK law criminalizes solidarity strikes. The HBO series House of the Dragon thus continued its UK-based filming with SAG-AFTRA actors operating under Equity contracts, prompting backlash among fans of the series.On July 17, the Ficus trees on Barham Boulevard's sidewalk outside Gate 8 were pruned almost entirely of their leaves. Pine trees on the opposite side of Barham were not touched, nor were a row of pepper trees behind the fence near the production gate. The pruning was described as a vindictive action because the trees had been being used by protesters as shade from the over 90 °F (32 °C) summer temperatures of Southern California. The pruning was also described as illegal, on the grounds that the trees are owned by the city and that Los Angeles' tree ordinances prohibit trimming them between July and September. NBCUniversal issued a statement to Deadline Hollywood denying that the trimming was done out of malice, claiming that they trim the trees outside the park in July annually for safety, and describing it and the obstructive construction hazards as ""unintended challenges for demonstrators"". NBCUniversal was fined US$250 for violating tree laws and destroying city property.Also on July 17, SAG-AFTRA released a twelve-page statement outlining the breakdown in negotiations, and terms they found unacceptable, including but not limited to a five-percent salary increase for actors, while the union had asked for eleven percent. The AMPTP released a counter-statement, highlighting that its actions were being ""deliberately distort[ed]"" and that SAG-AFTRA had chosen to pass over ""the most lucrative deal we have ever negotiated... valued at $318 million over the three-year term of the contract.""On July 18, NBCUniversal was accused of conducting business at Universal Studios Hollywood to deter or endanger the protesters and infringe on their rights to protest. In response, SAG-AFTRA and WGA issued a joint grievance to the National Labor Relations Board against NBCUniversal, accusing the company of interfering with their freedom to picket and endangering their members. Writers Guild of America West additionally filed a petition to the AMPTP in response to NBCUniversal's failure to install barriers to protect WGA and SAG-AFTRA protestors from the risk of being forced into traffic. NBCUniversal responded to The Hollywood Reporter in a statement: ""We are aware of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA complaints. We strongly believe that the company has fulfilled our legal obligations under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and we will cooperate with respect to any inquiries by the National Labor Relations Board on this issue. While we understand the timing of our multi-year construction project has created challenges for demonstrators, we continue to work with public agencies to increase access. We support the unions' rights to demonstrate safely.""On July 19, 2023, SAG-AFTRA approved more films to be shot during the strike, including Ishana Night Shyamalan's The Watchers, Sam Raimi's Don't Move, and David Lowery's Mother Mary. 56 films then became eligible to shoot under strike rules.On July 25, 2023, thousands of actors rallied Tuesday morning at Times Square from 9:30 A.M. to noon to voice their concerns about fair treatment and wages. SAG-AFTRA's main contractual negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland spoke about the struggle that the union is facing with the AMPTP.  Many celebrities gave speeches to express their concerns about the future of their union and technological advancements in the industry.  In attendance were: Lauren Ambrose, Matt Bomer, Christine Baranski, Steve Buscemi, Bobby Cannavale, Tituss Burgess, Liza Colón-Zayas, Bryan Cranston, Jessica Chastain, Gregory Diaz, Jennifer Ehle, Brendan Fraser, Nancy Giles, Danai Gurira, Jill Hennessy, Marin Hinkle, Stephen Lang, Arian Moayed, Christopher Meloni, Chloë Grace Moretz, Wendell Pierce, Michael Shannon, Christian Slater, Corey Stoll, Merritt Wever and Rachel Zegler."

1326,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Sep-23,"On September 1, the SAG-AFTRA National Board voted to send the video game strike authorization vote to its members, and on September 25, the results showed the authorization passed with 98.32% voting in favor.After the WGA and AMPTP reached a tentative agreement on September 24, leading to the official end of the WGA strike on September 27, SAG-AFTRA announced that it remains on strike, and called for renewed negotiations with the AMPTP. Later on September 27, SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP made a joint announcement that ""SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP will resume negotiations for a new TV/Theatrical contract on Monday, October 2."""
1327,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Oct-23,"On October 2, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP met for negotiations, in the first meeting between the two unions since the SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14. Unlike the WGA's negotiations, the SAG-AFTRA's negotiations were held at SAG-AFTRA's headquarters on Wilshire Boulevard rather than the AMPTP's headquarters in Sherman Oaks as, according to Deadline, SAG-AFTRA officials were displeased ""with the AMPTP's setup"" and wanted a change of scenery. Participants included AMPTP chief Carol Lombardini, Donna Langley (NBCUniversal), David Zaslav (Warner Bros. Discovery), Ted Sarandos (Netflix), Bob Iger (Disney), as well as SAG-AFTRA's Fran Drescher, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, and Ray Rodriguez. The meeting concluded with an announcement that they would meet again on the 4th. This pattern continued from October 4 to 9, when a joint statement announced a meeting on October 11. However, negotiations broke down on October 11.Beginning October 12, numerous reasons were given as to why negotiations stopped. Sarandos said that talks broke down because SAG-AFTRA ""introduced a levy on subscribers on top of [other] areas"" which he said was ""a bridge too far."" However, SAG-AFTRA accused the AMPTP of using ""bully tactics"", with SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher, stating that the AMPTP ""had given us a proposal package. We worked for like 36 hours on it. We brought it back to them. We walked them through it and they left and then called a few hours later and said, 'We're breaking negotiations.'"" Drescher has also said that SAG-AFTRA wants to continue negotiations. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland (SAG-AFTRA) also responded stating that, ""the public statement from the CEOs in their press release from the AMPTP characterized our demands as excessive. But really we don't think they are. The numbers they've been using are wildly overstated.""On October 16, SAG-AFTRA announced that it will schedule negotiations regarding a new video game contract.On October 19, Deadline Hollywood reported that a Zoom call between Hollywood stars (George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson, Kerry Washington, Tyler Perry, Bradley Cooper, Meryl Streep, Jennifer Aniston, Robert De Niro, Ben Affleck, Laura Dern, Emma Stone, Reese Witherspoon, Ryan Reynolds, and Ariana DeBose) and SAG-AFTRA leaders introduced a proposal that ""amounts to the town's biggest earners defraying the costs to AMPTP signatories by eliminating the cap on membership dues, to be used to bolster health benefits and other areas that SAG-AFTRA is trying to shore up. The offer would remove the $1 million cap on membership dues,"" and ultimately would have brought $150 million over three years. While Crabtree-Ireland found the proposal ""worthy of review and consideration"" as ""someone wanting to help is not someone wanting to undermine,"" Drescher ultimately rejected the offer, saying that it is not feasible. She instead called upon the AMPTP to resume negotiations with SAG-AFTRA.On October 20, actress and former SAG president Melissa Gilbert dismissed a message from SAG-AFTRA stating that actors should not wear Halloween costumes of characters from ""struck companies,"" and said: ""THIS is what you guys come up with? Literally no one cares what anyone wears for Halloween ... do you really think this kind of infantile stuff is going to end the strike? ... please tell me you're going to make this rule go away... and go negotiate!... people are suffering mightily... this is the kind of silly bullshit that keeps us on strike.""On October 21, a joint statement announced that negotiations would resume on October 24, 2023. After a full day of negotiations on the 24th, the initial plan of meeting on October 25 was moved to October 26. Negotiations thus resumed on October 26, with Crabtree-Ireland stating that they are ""100% focused on making a fair deal at the table ... I am cautiously optimistic that can happen. I don't really want to characterize what's going on in the room but we're really focused on just staying prepared and focused on getting the negotiations done."" An individual also speculated to The Wrap that ""studios believe that if they can’t reach a deal in the next week with the Screen Actors Guild, which has been on strike since July 14, then no new production will be able to start before 2024."" After the meeting, they announced that negotiations will continue on October 27. Also on October 26, a public letter signed by thousands of high-profile actors was sent to the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee encouraging them to keep fighting for their values rather than cave in to the studios' demands, saying, ""As hard as this is, we would rather stay on strike than take a bad deal.""On October 27, 2023, negotiations continued, but no deal was made, and it was announced that talks will continue over the weekend. The four studio CEOs did not attend the meeting, and Lombardini attended in their stead. The meeting on October 28 was conducted virtually between SAG-AFTRA leaders Drescher, Crabtree-Ireland and the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee, with the guild awaiting a response from the studios, and plans to meet again on October 29.Then, after intermittent communications on October 29, a guild source told Deadline Hollywood that there ""is a feeling of optimism... looks like we're in the final stretch."" Deadline also states that ""both sides expressed confidence a deal may be reached within days, but as before cautioned the situation is still fluid. From our understanding, SAG-AFTRA and the studios have gained 'significant' traction on bridging their gap over what has been termed as success-based compensation for streaming shows and their casts."" Late in the evening SAG-AFTRA  stated: ""Both parties will be working independently Monday and re-engage on scheduling at the end of the day."" The next day, Crabtree-Ireland informed Deadline that the weekend talks were ""productive,"" and he continues to remain ""cautiously optimistic about making progress."" Also according to Deadline, he said that SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP are ""not just 'dotting I's and crossing T's' just yet... He added that AI is the current focus of talks."" Later in the afternoon a ""well-positioned individual"" told Deadline Hollywood that ""There's still a lot of work to be done."" Another source told Deadline, ""there's a lot of common ground now, and we are building on that... details still have to be determined, but we're heading in the right direction."" That evening, SAG-AFTRA released a statement saying they would meet again on October 31.On October 31, talks ended early out of consideration of families celebrating Halloween, with the intention to meet again on November 1, and with plans to have further meetings later in the week if needed."
1328,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Timeline of negotiations and strike activity,Nov-23,"Meetings continued from November 1 to November 3. On November 4, SAG-AFTRA lead negotiators stated that they ""received an offer today from the AMPTP, which they characterized as their 'Last, Best, and Final Offer' ... we are reviewing it and considering our response within the context of the critical issues addressed in our proposals."" On November 5, SAG-AFTRA sent a statement to its members saying that the negotiating team had ""analyzed and thoroughly discussed the AMPTP's counter proposal all day and well into the night and will continue our deliberations on Monday.""  On November 6, SAG-AFTRA sent a letter to members that said: ""This morning our negotiators formally responded to the AMPTP’s 'Last, Best & Final' offer ... there are several essential items on which we still do not have an agreement, including AI."" Later that evening, Deadline Hollywood reported that the virtual meeting ended late, with plans to continue negotiations. A studio insider told Deadline that, ""this was a productive session, some work still required before there’s a deal."" On November 7, SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP met again. A ""guild source"" told Deadline Hollywood that they ""are very close ... not done yet, but very close with strong protection language in place."" However, the meeting ended without a deal, and with plans to continue talking on November 8. In addition, Deadline Hollywood reported that it ""heard from several sources that guild president Fran Drescher was pinged by A-list stars asking about whether a deal was nigh."" Also on November 7, Tyler Perry gave an interview on CBS Mornings. While praising the SAG-AFTRA lead negotiators, he also stated that the work stoppage has been ""debilitating,"" and that ""it's really important to know when we've won. This is only a three-year deal. In two years, two-and-a-half years, we'll be renegotiating again ... so we have to know what have we won, and what have we won for now? That's the thing. For now. [...] If I had ran my business trying to get everything at once, I wouldn't be here. I've got as much as I can for now, so let's see what we can do next.""On November 8, 2023, SAG-AFTRA released a statement to its members that announced the end of the strike: “We are thrilled and proud to tell you that today your TV/Theatrical Negotiating Committee voted unanimously to approve a tentative agreement with the AMPTP. As of 12:01am on November 9, our strike is officially suspended and all picket locations are closed."" The SAG-AFTRA's National Board committee then approved the agreement by a majority of 86%. The summary of the agreement would be published on November 13, 2023. Voting among SAG-AFTRA members began on November 14 and is scheduled to conclude on December 5."
1329,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Strike activity and responses,Locations,"SAG-AFTRA's strikes in Los Angeles targeted the major film studios as well as offices for companies. Drescher personally joined the strikes outside of Netflix's offices. Josh Gad was among the protestors at Fox Entertainment's picket lines. Allison Janney, Kaitlyn Dever, Logan Lerman, and Joey King joined protests at Warner Bros., and actresses Constance Zimmer and Ginnifer Goodwin took part in picket lines at Paramount's Los Angeles studios. Disney's offices saw picket lines whose notable members included Mandy Moore, Michelle Monaghan, Raini and Rico Rodriguez, Danielle Fishel, and Ben Schwartz.SAG-AFTRA's New York picketing action took place at Paramount's New York headquarters at 1515 Broadway and various offices of NBCUniversal, including Rockefeller Center. Jason Sudeikis joined the NBCUniversal picket lines, stating that actors would strike for ""as long as it takes"", as did Joe Pantoliano, the Naked Cowboy, Alex Edelman, and Sarah Sherman. Meanwhile, at Paramount's headquarters, picket lines included Michael Schur and Kevin Bacon.SAG-AFTRA also staged brief strikes at other locations outside of New York and Los Angeles. Branded as ""Quick Photo Op"" strikes, these took place in Orlando, Honolulu, and Atlanta. The union stated it plans to launch more protests across the country, requesting that SAG-AFTRA members contact their local executives for details."
1330,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Strike activity and responses,Media executives' response,"Before the end of SAG-AFTRA's negotiations, one anonymous AMPTP executive stated that their current strategy was to ""allow things to drag on until union members [started] losing their apartments and losing their houses"" to force SAG-AFTRA into less favorable negotiating positions.Casey Bloys, CEO of HBO and Max, said the strike ""will slow everything down."" He predicted the strike would heavily affect HBO's 2024 season.Bob Iger, the CEO of The Walt Disney Company, said the actors' demands were ""not realistic"", adding they were ""adding to the set of challenges that this business is already facing"". Iger has been criticized for these remarks in light of his contract with Disney, which allows him to earn as much as $27 million in 2023 between his salary and bonuses. TheWrap wrote Iger makes over 500 times the median salary of Disney employees, while Town & Country wrote it was actually 1,242 times a Disney employee's median salary. When asked about Iger's remarks, Drescher described them as ""repugnant"" and ""tone deaf."" She went on to call Iger a ""land baron"" who ""has no idea about what is really happening"". The Wall Street Journal also called Iger ""tone deaf"". Actor Bryan Cranston responded to Iger in part: ""We will not be having our jobs taken away and given to robots."""
1331,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Strike activity and responses,Politicians' response,"U.S. President Joe Biden, Vermont U.S. senator Bernie Sanders, and Mayor of Los Angeles Karen Bass have voiced their support for the actors' union. Biden had previously supported the writers on strike in May 2023. Some politicians joined the picket lines themselves, including Burbank mayor Konstantine Anthony (himself a SAG-AFTRA member) and California U.S. Representative Adam Schiff. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined the picket line in front of Netflix studios in New York City. She criticized the wealth of studio executives while the average screenwriter or actor struggles to get access to healthcare, and she emphasized the power of direct action in achieving economic victories.Both Bass and Governor of California Gavin Newsom have offered to help mediate an end to the strikes."
1332,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Strike activity and responses,Other unions' response,"Numerous other labor unions in the United States expressed support for the strike. Along with the Writers' Guild, statements of support were released by the Directors Guild and Producers Guild. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, itself in a contractual dispute with UPS and scheduled to go on strike at the end of July if no deal is reached, expressed support through a statement released by their president, Sean O'Brien. The AFL–CIO additionally threw their support behind SAG-AFTRA, as did the Department for Professional Employees, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, and the Writers Guild of America, East."
1333,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Strike activity and responses,Other organizations' response,"Two forthcoming film festivals, the Toronto International Film Festival and the Venice International Film Festival, have acknowledged the potential impact of the strike and its associated ban on promotional appearances by actors if the strike is not resolved by September but have indicated that both events will proceed regardless, with an increase of Canadian, European, Asian, and South American titles in all sections being expected. However, leaders of SAG-AFTRA had been adamant that actors in movies with interim agreements should be at festivals to promote them."
1334,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Strike activity and responses,Impacted productions,"On October 30, 2023, the Hunger Games prequel film The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes was given an interim agreement so that actors could promote the film during the strike."
1335,2023 SAG-AFTRA strike,Notes,,
1336,SpaceX Starship Second Integrated Flight Test,Summary,,"The Second Integrated Flight Test (IFT-2) of the SpaceX Starship launched on November 18, 2023, from SpaceX's Starbase launch site. The Starship successfully lifted off under the power of all 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster and made it through stage separation. However, the booster had multiple engine failures during reentry and exploded, while the Starship continued to fly for over 8 minutes, reaching an altitude of 148 km (92 mi), before also disintegrating. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a statement confirming that an anomaly had occurred and that there are no reports of public property damage or injuries. SpaceX nevertheless described the test as a ""success""."
1337,SpaceX Starship Second Integrated Flight Test,Background,Development prior to the launch,"The FAA oversaw the investigation of Starship's first test flight failure, at the end of which SpaceX reported it had identified 63 needed corrective actions, 57 of which needed to be completed before another Starship launch license could take place. The remaining 6 actions are to be completed in the future On September 8, 2023, the FAA concurred with SpaceX's report and closed the investigation. The FAA also announced that the full investigatory report would not be released due to confidential contents including export control information. FAA officials stated, ""The closure of the mishap investigation does not signal an immediate resumption of Starship launches at Boca Chica."" The FWS had not yet started a formal review of SpaceX's modifications, and based on the 135 day review period, the launch could have been postponed to NET 2024. The FWS received the final biological assessment from the Federal Aviation Administration. William H. Gerstenmaier, SpaceX's Vice President of Build and Flight Reliability, called on the FAA to increase licensing staff. On October 19, 2023 the FWS surveyed the area around Starbase and the consultation with the FAA has been extended into November. The FWS reviewed the changes to the launch pad, especially the water deluge system. By October 31, 2023, the FAA had concluded the safety review portion of the launch license.On November 11, 2023, SpaceX announced that they were targeting a launch date of November 17, pending regulatory approval. On November 14, the FWS concluded its environmental review. On the same day the FAA gave its approval for launch. On November 16, the flight was delayed one day, due to a grid fin actuator needing to be replaced on B9."
1338,SpaceX Starship Second Integrated Flight Test,Background,Changes from the previous flight,"Significant changes implemented by SpaceX compared to the previous flight include an expansion of the Super Heavy's fire suppression system in order to mitigate any potential engine bay fires. SpaceX re-qualified their autonomous flight safety system, which had malfunctioned during the first flight.Other changes unrelated to the previous flights include a hot-stage separation system, in which Starship's second stage engines can ignite while Starship is still attached to push the ship away from the booster. SpaceX replaced the hydraulic systems of Super Heavy Raptor engines with an electronic thrust vector control, citing fewer potential points of failure and more energy efficiency.The orbital launch mount and pad system was reinforced in a way that, according to SpaceX, should prevent a recurrence of the pad foundation failure observed during the first flight test. SpaceX also added, and tested, a flame deflector for the launchpad."
1339,SpaceX Starship Second Integrated Flight Test,Flight profile,,"The spacecraft flight plan was to lift off from SpaceX's Starbase facility along the south Texas coast, then conduct a partial orbit around Earth. The Super Heavy had a planned boostback burn followed by a soft water landing in the Gulf of Mexico, similarly to a Falcon 9 performing a return to launch site landing (RTLS). The Starship spacecraft was then to re-enter the atmosphere and perform a water landing in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii, without performing a landing burn."
1340,SpaceX Starship Second Integrated Flight Test,Launch,,"The first launch attempt of the second integrated flight test occurred on November 18 at 13:03 UTC (8:03 a.m. EST, 7:03 a.m. CST). The launch was originally scheduled for November 17, but was postponed by one day due to a failed grid fin actuator needing to be replaced.Starship launched as planned on November 18, 2023, though roughly three minutes behind schedule due to a pressure issue with the spacecraft.
Maximum aerodynamic stress (Max q) was surpassed with no anomalies encountered. 2 minutes and 39 seconds after engine ignition, 30 of the 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster were shut down as planned, followed by successful hot staging with second stage engine ignition two seconds later.While Starship's second stage continued accelerating, the Super Heavy booster used its cold gas thrusters to execute a flip maneuver and began its boostback burn. One of the ten engines that was to be reignited for this burn failed to do so. Throughout the boostback burn more engines failed, including one of the engines that did not shut down at stage separation. At 3 minutes and 21 seconds after launch, the booster exploded, necessitating an FAA investigation.
While the second stage engines were planned to shut down at T+8:33, a frame-by-frame analysis of the SpaceX broadcast shows the following sequence: at T+8:03 telemetry indicates all engines had turned off, at T+8:04 a series of faint irregular flashes of light and an expanding gas cloud first become visible, at T+8:06 the final altitude velocity update at 148 kilometres (92 mi) is shown, and at T+8:12 the gas cloud reaches its largest apparent diameter. According to astronomer Jonathan McDowell, at his predicted re-entry point, NOAA weather radar picked up a debris cloud a few hundred miles north of the Virgin Islands. After some dead air, the commentators asserted Starship was entering the coast phase at T+9:50 before finally announcing ""we may have lost the second stage"" at T+11:40. At T+12:20 the commentators speculated the Autonomous Flight Termination System triggered. An official analysis of the exact sequence of events is still pending."
1341,SpaceX Starship Second Integrated Flight Test,Aftermath,,"SpaceX and Cameron County reopened the road to the launch site a few hours after the launch. This was noted by CNN as a faster reopening than during the first flight attempt, when it remained closed for two days."

1378,Survivor Series: WarGames (2023),Summary,,"The 2023 Survivor Series: WarGames is the upcoming 37th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It will be held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event will take place on Saturday, November 25, 2023, at the Allstate Arena in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois, marking the third Survivor Series to be held at this arena after the 1989 and 2019 events (The arena was known as Rosemont Horizon for the 1989 event until it was renamed in 1999). It is the second Survivor Series to include the WarGames concept after it was first introduced to WWE's main roster in 2022."
1379,Survivor Series: WarGames (2023),Production,Background,"Survivor Series is an annual professional wrestling event produced every November by the American company WWE since 1987, generally held the week of Thanksgiving. The second longest running pay-per-view (PPV) event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's five biggest events of the year, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, Royal Rumble, and Money in the Bank, referred to as the ""Big Five"". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically features teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. In a break from tradition, the 2022 event did not include any Survivor Series or elimination type matches and was instead based around the WarGames match with the event titled Survivor Series: WarGames.On July 7, 2023, WWE announced that they would be returning to the Allstate Arena in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois for the 37th Survivor Series on Saturday, November 25. This will be the third Survivor Series to be held at this arena after the 1989 and 2019 events, and it will feature wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. In addition to airing on PPV worldwide, it will be available to livestream on Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network in most international markets. Additionally, the November 24 episode of Friday Night SmackDown will be held at the same arena. Tickets went on sale on July 21 via Ticketmaster. During Crown Jewel on November 4, it was announced that the 2023 event would retain the WarGames concept."
1380,Survivor Series: WarGames (2023),Production,Storylines,"The event will include matches that result from scripted storylines. Results are predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines are produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown.On the October 30 episode of Raw, Intercontinental Champion Gunther was supposed to be a guest on The Miz's talk show, ""Miz TV""; however, Miz was interrupted by Gunther's Imperium stablemates Giovanni Vinci and Ludwig Kaiser, who stated that Gunther would not appear. After some arguing, however, Gunther came out and stated that he did not respect Miz, as he viewed Miz more as an ""entertainer"" than a serious wrestler, with Miz then saying that he himself was the one who had made the Intercontinental Championship prestigious and could do it again. After Imperium began to destroy the ""Miz TV"" set, Miz attacked Imperium, but Gunther got the upper hand, turning Miz face for the first time since January 2020. Later, Miz asked Raw General Manager Adam Pearce for a championship match against Gunther, but Pearce declined as there were others who also wanted a title match. A fatal four-way match was then scheduled for the next episode to determine Gunther's challenger for the Intercontinental Championship at Survivor Series: WarGames, which Miz won.At Crown Jewel, Zoey Stark was part of a fatal five-way match for Rhea Ripley's Women's World Championship, which Ripley retained. On the following episode of Raw, Stark won a battle royal to face Ripley for the title one-on-one at Survivor Series: WarGames.Since June, Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins, Cody Rhodes, Jey Uso, and Sami Zayn had all been involved in various rivalries with The Judgment Day (Finn Bálor, Damian Priest, and ""Dirty"" Dominik Mysterio) and their associate, JD McDonagh, encompassing matches for Rollins' World Heavyweight Championship and the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship, which had been exchanged between Rhodes & Uso and Bálor & Priest. At the conclusion of the November 6 episode of Raw, a brawl ensued between all eight men. Fed up with the constant chaos caused by The Judgment Day, Raw General Manager Adam Pearce announced that Rollins, Rhodes, Uso, and Zayn would face Judgment Day and McDonagh in a WarGames match at Survivor Series: WarGames. The following week, Rhodes and Priest were revealed as the leaders of their respective teams while McDonagh was made an official member of The Judgment Day. Additionally, a singles match between a member of each team was scheduled for the next week to determine who would get the advantage in the WarGames match.At SummerSlam, Bianca Belair defeated Asuka and Charlotte Flair in a triple threat match to win the WWE Women's Championship, but immediately after the match, Iyo Sky cashed in her Money in the Bank contract and defeated Belair to win the title. After the event, Damage CTRL (Bayley, Dakota Kai, and Sky) began feuding with Asuka, as well as Flair, who sided with Asuka. Damage CTRL would also injure Belair's knee, taking her out for the next couple of months. During this time, Sky retained her championship in matches against Asuka and Flair thanks to interference from Bayley and Kai. After Belair made her return in late October, Sky retained the title against her at Crown Jewel after a returning Kairi Sane (in her first appearance since July 2020) interfered. On the following SmackDown, Sky and Kai said they brought Sane in to make their group stronger. Sane praised Bayley for her leadership of Damage CTRL and also said that she forgave Bayley for attacking her back in July 2020. The group then embraced but were interrupted by Belair, Flair, and Asuka with Belair stating that she assumed wrong of Sky, believing that Sky could defend her championship without help. A six-woman tag team match then took place, which ended in a no contest after Asuka turned on her team, subsequently reuniting with Sane and joining with Damage CTRL. Shotzi attempted to make the save, but was laid out by Damage CTRL. The following week, Damage CTRL challenged Belair, Flair, Shotzi, and a partner of their choosing, which was later revealed to be Raw's Becky Lynch, to a WarGames match, which was accepted. That same night, WWE announced that a fan vote would be held to determine which team would receive the WarGames advantage.On the November 10 episode of SmackDown, Rey Mysterio and the Latino World Order (LWO) addressed Mysterio's loss of the United States Championship at Crown Jewel to Logan Paul, who used brass knuckles to win. Carlito blamed Santos Escobar as he had left the brass knuckles on the ring apron. Escobar then left the ring in disbelief of the accusation, but later turned heel on Mysterio by injuring his left knee and striking it with the steel steps. The following week, Escobar said that Mysterio was his hero, but after meeting him, he realized he was wrong. A confrontation with the other LWO members (Joaquin Wilde, Cruz Del Toro, and Zelina Vega) occurred, where Escobar attacked Wilde and Toro. Carlito came out for the save but Escobar escaped. Later, a match between Carlito and Escobar was scheduled for Survivor Series: WarGames."

1397,2023 Virginia House of Delegates election,Summary,,"The 2023 Virginia House of Delegates election took place on November 7, 2023, concurrently with elections for the Virginia Senate, to elect members of the 163rd Virginia General Assembly. All 100 delegates are elected to two-year terms from single-member districts. Nomination primaries held through the Department of Elections were held June 20, 2023. Democrats gained 3 seats, winning back control with a 51-49 majority after having previously lost it in 2021. The outcome in the 82nd District has yet to be determined, with a recount requested."
1398,2023 Virginia House of Delegates election,Background,,"Following the 2021 election, Republicans regained control of the House of Delegates that was lost to the Democrats in 2019. They controlled a narrow majority of 52 seats prior to the 2023 election.After the 2022 General Assembly session, House Democrats voted via a secret ballot to remove former speaker and then-minority leader Eileen Filler-Corn from the top of party leadership. House Democrats would replace Filler-Corn with Don Scott as the new minority leader.The 2023 election was the first held under new district maps following redistricting as a result of the 2020 census. In 2020, voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment to create an independent redistricting committee. This committee ultimately failed to agree on a newly drawn map. The districts delegates ran in were created by two special masters appointed by the Supreme Court of Virginia."
